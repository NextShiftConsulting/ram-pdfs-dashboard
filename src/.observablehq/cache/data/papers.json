Evaluation\nof LLM applications traditionally relies on human audits,\na process that is neither scalable nor cost-effective, espe-\ncially when dealing with large, diverse datasets collected\nfrom real-world applications. To address this challenge, re-\ncent work (Saad-Falcon et al. 2024; Zheng et al. 2023a; Es\net al. 2024; Dong, Hu, and Collier 2024) has explored us-\ning LLMs themselves as evaluators, leveraging their strong\nreasoning capabilities and contextual comprehension.

Our training code is available at\nhttps://github.com/naver/bergen/tree/main/scripts/xprovence.\n1. Introduction\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged\nas a powerful paradigm for grounding Large Language\nModels (LLMs) in external knowledge (Lewis et al.,\n2020).\nBy retrieving and conditioning on domain-\nspecific contexts, RAG systems have demonstrated\nstrong performance across a wide range of applications.\nThe increasing capabilities of LLMs have in turn made\nRAG pipelines more effective.\nHowever, the benefits of RAG come with significant com-\nputational costs. Retrieved documents substantially in-\ncrease the input context length, leading to quadratic\ngrowth in inference time, higher deployment costs,\nand a larger carbon footprint. Consequently, reduc-\ning the size of the context fed to the LLM has become a\nkey research focus. Among various compression strate-\ngies (Wang et al., 2023; Yoon et al., 2024; Cheng et al.,\n2024; Louis et al., 2025; Rau et al., 2025), the selec-\ntive removal of irrelevant content from retrieved docu-\nments, known as context pruning, has shown particular\npromise (Jiang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Chirkova\net al., 2025; Hwang et al., 2024).\nA state-of-the-art approach in this space is Provence\n(Chirkova et al., 2025), which introduces a zero-cost\npruning mechanism integrated directly into the rerank-\ning stage of the RAG pipeline.\nBy leveraging the\nreranker’s query-aware representations, Provence la-\nbels sentences as relevant or irrelevant and prunes\nnon-relevant content prior to generation. This sim-\nple yet effective design yields significant runtime im-\nprovements without compromising performance. How-\never, Provence remains limited to English, constrain-\ning its applicability in multilingual settings (Chirkova\net al., 2024). In this work, we address these limitations\nby introducing XProvence, a multilingual extension of\nProvence.

VQA on egocentric images from wearable devices such\nas smart glasses is even harder: as illustrated in Figure 1, wide-angle viewpoints render entities small, and\nthe entities themselves are often long-tail or niche, making them unlikely to be reliably covered by an LLM’s\ninternal knowledge.\nMultimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) has strengthened factual grounding in VQA (Marino\net al., 2021; Lin et al., 2022; Jian et al., 2024), but two limitations persist. First, most MM-RAG systems\neither retrieve with the full image (Shah et al., 2019; Marino et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023; Yan and Xie,\n2024; Yu et al.; Ha et al., 2025; Sidhu et al., 2025), or use text-only queries that simply paraphrase the\nimage (Narasimhan and Schwing, 2018; Gardères et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2022; Salaberria et al., 2023).\nFull-image retrieval pulls in distracting background, while text-only cues (e.g., “car”) lack the specificity needed\nfor fine-grained entity grounding and enrichment. Second, MM-RAG pipelines are often modular—detectors,\nsegmenters, captioners, etc.—to form queries, thus can introduce cross-modal translation errors, struggle with\ncomposing multiple queries, and add latency when retrieval is not truly necessary.\nWe present PixSearch, the first end-to-end framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning. During generation,\nPixSearch (i) learns when to retrieve by emitting <search> tokens, (ii) decides how to retrieve by routing\namong text, whole-image, and region-level queries via token outputs, and (iii) grounds answers in the retrieved\nevidence, supporting multi-step search. Built on segmenting LMMs (Large Multi-modal Models with segmenta-\ntion capabilities), PixSearch natively produces segmentation masks without external detection/segmentation\nAPIs, and uses these masks directly as retrieval queries. This yields pixel-level, context-aware grounding that\nsurpasses modular, text- or tool-driven pipelines.\n1\narXiv:2601.19060v1  [cs.CV]  27 Jan 2026\n\nSearch \nIndex\nUser Query:\nIs this car suitable for sea0ng more than seven people?\nTool-Reliant \nApproaches\nCar\nP...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:01 by YRSN Research Monitor (rule-based)*\n*Tip: Set AWS credentials or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for LLM-powered analysis*\n"

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by grounding answers in external sources, e.g., knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing KG-based RAG approaches rely on semantics-unaware path sampling and are weakly aligned with KG reasoning objectives, which limits further accuracy gains. They also feed retrieved paths directly into the reasoner without organizing them into answer-centered reasoning paths, hindering small LLMs' ability to leverage the retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, prior works predominantly rely on large LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT/GPT-4) or assume backbones above 7B parameters, leaving sub-7B models underexplored. We address this gap with RPO-RAG, the first KG-based RAG framework specifically designed for small LLMs, to the best of our knowledge. RPO-RAG introduces three key innovations: (1) a query-path semantic sampling strategy that provides informative supervisory signals; (2) a relation-aware preference optimization that aligns training with intermediate KG reasoning signals (e.g., relation); and (3) an answer-centered prompt design that organizes entities and reasoning paths in an interpretable format. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that RPO-RAG effectively bridges the performance gap between small and large language models. On WebQSP, it improves F1 by up to 8.8%, reflecting enhanced answer precision, while on CWQ it achieves new state-of-the-art results among models under 8B parameters in both Hit and F1. Overall, RPO-RAG substantially improves the reasoning capability of small LLMs, even under 3B parameters-highlighting their potential for resource-efficient and practical on-device KGQA applications.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*Enable LLM backend for intelligent extraction*\n\n1.

Most conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\npipelines rely on relevance-based retrieval, which often misaligns with\nutility – that is, whether the retrieved passages actually improve the\nquality of the generated text specific to a downstream task such as ques-\ntion answering or query-based summarization. The limitations of exist-\ning utility-driven retrieval approaches for RAG are that, firstly, they\nare resource-intensive typically requiring query encoding, and that sec-\nondly, they do not involve listwise ranking loss during training. The\nlatter limitation is particularly critical, as the relative order between\ndocuments directly affects generation in RAG. To address this gap, we\npropose Lightweight Utility-driven Reranking for Efficient RAG (LURE-\nRAG), a framework that augments any black-box retriever with an effi-\ncient LambdaMART-based reranker. Unlike prior methods, LURE-RAG\ntrains the reranker with a listwise ranking loss guided by LLM utility,\nthereby directly optimizing the ordering of retrieved documents. Exper-\niments on two standard datasets demonstrate that LURE-RAG achieves\ncompetitive performance, reaching 97–98% of the state-of-the-art dense\nneural baseline, while remaining efficient in both training and inference.\nMoreover, its dense variant, UR-RAG, significantly outperforms the best\nexisting baseline by up to 3%.\nKeywords: RAG, listwise ranking, lightweight reranker\n1\nIntroduction\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong ability to generate fluent and\noften factually grounded text, yet they are limited by their parametric knowl-\nedge (which is fixed at training time) [28,4]. They may also hallucinate or fail on\ndomain-specific or newly emerging information. Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion (RAG) has emerged as a prominent framework to address these limitations\nby combining external retrieval of relevant documents with language model gen-\neration [38,12]. RAG systems first retrieve documents or passages from some cor-\npus given an input, then augment the LLM’s input with those documents, and\nfinally generate a response grounded on both retrieved and internal knowledge.\nRAG has become a core paradigm in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks [18,14].\narXiv:2601.19535v1  [cs.IR]  27 Jan 2026\n\n2\nM. Chandra et al.\nRAG systems usually consist of multiple modules including at least a retriever\nand a generator. Some systems may have other modules to further enhance effec-\ntiveness on downstream tasks, like a reranker [13] or a decision maker deciding\nwhen to retrieve [22,11].\nIn many RAG pipelines [4,12], relevance is defined in the traditional IR sense,\nsuch as lexical or semantic similarity between documents and the query. However,\nin the RAG setting, semantic relevance to the query alone does not necessarily\ntranslate into utility for the LLM’s downstream generation [40,9,42], that is,\nwhether the retrieved documents actually help the model produce more accu-\nrate, coherent, or useful answers. This discrepancy arises because, even when\ndocuments are individually relevant, concatenating them into a single context\nmay introduce incoherence or inconsistency, which can in turn mislead the LLM\nand degrade the quality of the generated output. Moreover, even if a document\nis semantically similar to an input question, it may miss crucial facts required for\nthe correct answer generation. Recent works [11,38] showed that using utility-\ndriven signals (e.g. metrics derived from LLM outputs and the ground-truth\nanswers) as supervision can better align retrieval (and subsequent reranking in\nsome cases) to what improves generation.\nDespite the progress in the direction of utility-driven signals, there remain\nimportant gaps. Firstly, the loss functions used in ...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:01 by YRSN Research Monitor (rule-based)*\n*Tip: Set AWS credentials or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for LLM-powered analysis*\n"

Introduction\nAlice is head of the HR department at Condorcet Consulting. Each year, Condorcet Consulting offers\nseveral different internship positions and receives a large number of applications. The task of the HR\nteam is to decide which applicant should be assigned to which internship position, with some applicants\nonly being eligible for a subset of the positions. This task becomes all the more difficult because the\nCEO, CTO, and other members of the management board of the company would like to implement\ndifferent assignments of the applicants to positions. Therefore, Alice and her team must find a way to\naggregate these conflicting opinions into a single assignment. She quickly realizes that even deciding\nwhich principles she should apply when choosing a desirable assignment is not straightforward. What\ndoes it mean for one assignment to be better than another? And can one even determine that a proposed\nassignment has no clearly superior alternative?\nThe situation reminds her of voting scenarios, in which voters have preferences over candidates and a\nsingle compromise candidate must be selected: In her problem, each possible assignment of applicants to\npositions constitutes a candidate, and the members of the management board act as voters who express\npreferences over these candidates. Alice describes her problem to her friend Bob, who is an expert in\nvoting. He notices that, while similar in spirit, the problem differs in some ways fundamentally from\nstandard voting scenarios, where the candidate set is typically small and efficiently enumerable. In contrast,\nthe number of possible assignments in Alice’s problem grows exponentially with the number of applicants\nand positions, rendering most classical voting algorithms computationally intractable, as it becomes\n1\narXiv:2601.19653v1  [cs.GT]  27 Jan 2026\n\ninfeasible to iterate over all candidates. The two are thus left wondering how to aggregate the different\npreferences and how to do so in a computationally efficient way.\nWe model Alice’s problem as voting on matchings: given an underlying graph 𝐺, select a single\nmatching based on the voters’ preferences over possible matchings. The motivating example corresponds\nto a special case in which 𝐺is bipartite, with internship positions on one side and applicants on the\nother.1 We put forward a new perspective on decision-making in matching under preferences and resource\nallocation: In the extensive literature on matching under preferences [Manlove, 2013, Klaus et al., 2016]\nand on resource allocation [Bouveret et al., 2016], agents are typic...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:15 | Backend: template*\n"

Introduction \nModern digital systems face a persistent tension between security and usability. \nAuthentication mechanisms must be strong enough to prevent unauthorized access yet \nflexible enough to accommodate natural human variability. However, contemporary \nsystems continue to rely predominantly on “what you know” factors — passwords, PINs, \nand security questions — which are inherently rigid. These mechanisms require exact \nstring matches, leaving no allowance for paraphrasing, partial recall, or minor linguistic \nvariation. This strictness stands in contrast to the approximate and contextual nature of \nhuman memory and results in frequent authentication failures: a single misplaced \ncharacter can lock out a legitimate user, and password‑reset workflows similarly demand \nprecise answers to security questions. Such rigidity increases operational support costs \n \n1 Emunah S-S. Chan is with HKBUAS, email: emunah.chan@gmail.com. \n2 Aldar C-F.

Meanwhile, many security questions depend on information that \ncan be publicly discovered or socially engineered, further eroding their reliability. \nSimultaneously, online fraud has expanded in scale and sophistication. Global financial \nlosses continue to grow, fueled by phishing schemes, investment scams, romance \nscams, and business‑email‑compromise attacks. INTERPOL’s Global Financial Fraud \nAssessment (May 2024) reports that financial fraud has reached epidemic levels and \ndescribes financial fraud as a “massive and global” problem driven by the rapid \nexpansion of organized cyber-enabled crime [22]. Fraudsters rapidly evolve their tactics, \noften exploiting AI‑generated content and impersonation strategies to deceive victims. \nTraditional machine‑learning‑based fraud‑detection systems struggle to keep pace \nbecause they depend on static classifiers that must be constantly retrained as the \nfraudsters’ tactics evolve. \nThese challenges underscore the need for authentication and fraud-detection systems \nthat can adapt to dynamic linguistic behaviour and reason about human communication \nrather than rely on deterministic pattern matching.

INTRODUCTION\nRecent developments in code large language models (code\nLLMs) [1]–[4] have demonstrated impressive capability in\ngeneral code completion tasks [5]–[7], [7]–[10]. However,\nexisting code LLMs demonstrate suboptimal performance on\nrepository-level code completion tasks, primarily due to their\ninsufficient understanding of repository-specific context and\ndomain knowledge [11]. This limitation stems from the fact\nthat target code repositories are often newly created, propri-\netary, or work-in-progress projects, making it hard for code\nLLMs to acquire repository-specific knowledge during pre-\ntraining and fine-tuning phases [12]. To address this chal-\nlenge, one straightforward approach leverages the increasing\ncontext window length of modern models by concatenating\nall repository files into a single prompt. However, this naive\nconcatenation introduces substantial irrelevant information that\ninterferes with model generation [13], [14].

Ergodic\naverages can then be used to estimate expectations with respect to the posterior. Many\npopular MCMC methods are based on the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, in which\neach step of the Markov chain is simulated by proposing a new state according to a\ncandidate Markov kernel and then accepting or rejecting it depending on the ratio of\nthe target distribution π evaluated at the current and proposed locations.\nThe candidate kernel is often parametrized by a step size and algorithm perfor-\nmance crucially depends on this choice: when the step size is too small, the process\noften behaves like a random walk, while a step size that is too large leads to pro-\nposals that are rejected with high probability; in both cases the underlying Markov\nchain mixes slowly and ergodic averages are inefficient. A key contribution for under-\nstanding the trade-off between these regimes is given by diffusion/scaling limits, e.g.\nRoberts and Rosenthal (2001); Roberts et al. (1997); Yang et al. (2020); Beskos et al.\n(2013). Scaling limits facilitate analysis of the asymptotic performance of an algorithm\nin high dimensions and provide simple guidelines for optimally tuning the step size.\nThey also imply an order of complexity of the algorithm with respect to the number\nof dimensions of the target distribution (Roberts and Rosenthal 2016).\nLivingstone and Zanella (2022) recently showed that the performance of standard\ngradient-based methods such as the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA)\nand Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) can deteriorate (exponentially) quickly when\nthe step size is miss-specified. The framework is particularly insightful for explaining\npractical limitations of MCMC methods for target distributions with a complex geo-\nmetric struct...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:15 | Backend: template*\n"

Existing methods train the SID tokenizer (e.g. RQ-VAE) to reconstruct item content, but this is misaligned with the downstream recommendation task of predicting the next item's SID sequence. The authors propose DIGER, a method to make SIDs differentiable so the recommendation loss can directly influence SID learning. DIGER uses Gumbel noise to encourage exploration over codes in early training, mitigating codebook collapse. It also introduces uncertainty decay strategies to transition from exploration to exploitation. Experiments show DIGER improves recommendation performance by aligning indexing and recommendation objectives through differentiable SIDs.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Identifying the objective mismatch between content reconstruction for SID learning and the recommendation task in existing generative recommendation pipelines.\n2. Proposing DIGER, a method to make SIDs differentiable by introducing Gumbel noise to the SID assignment process.\n3. Designing uncertainty decay strategies to balance exploration and convergence when learning differentiable SIDs.  \n4. Extensive experiments validating DIGER's improvements on multiple datasets by enabling joint optimization of SID indexing and recommendation.\n5. Highlighting differentiable semantic indexing as a promising direction for generative recommendation.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core idea is to make the semantic ID (SID) assignment process differentiable by adding Gumbel noise, allowing gradients from the recommendation loss to flow back and update the SID tokenizer.\n\n### Architecture \nDIGER uses an RQ-VAE based tokenizer to obtain SIDs from item content. A generative transformer model takes the SID sequence as input to predict the next item's SID sequence.\n\n### Training/Optimization\n1. Gumbel-Softmax is used to make the SID assignment probabilistic and differentiable.\n2. Two uncertainty decay strategies (linear and exponential) are proposed to transition from exploration to exploitation when learning SIDs.\n3. Joint training by backpropagating the recommendation loss to update both the recommender and tokenizer.\n\n## Key Results\n| Dataset | Metric | Base RQ-VAE | DIGER (Linear Decay) | DIGER (Exp Decay) |\n|---------|---------|--------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| ML-1M   | NDCG@10 | 0.3712       | 0.3891 (+4.8%)       | 0.3928 (+5.8%)    |\n| Amazon  | HIT@10  | 0.6235       | 0.6415 (+2.9%)       | 0.6489 (+4.1%)    |\n| Yelp    | NDCG@10 | 0.0382       | 0.0421 (+10.2%)      | 0.0433 (+13.4%)   |\n\n## Strengths\n- Novel approach to address objective mismatch in generative recommendation\n- Effective uncertainty modeling for SID learning \n- Extensive experiments validating improvements\n- Promising direction for future research\n\n## Limitations\n- Additional complexity from differentiable components\n- Potential optimization challenges with large codebooks\n- No theoretical analysis of uncertainty decay strategies\n- Limited qualitative evaluation of learned SIDs\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe code and data used in this work are publicly available.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis work opens up new research directions for improving generative recommendation through differentiable semantic indexing. By aligning indexing and recommendation objectives, it can lead to more effective personalized recommendation. However, the added complexity and potential optimization challenges need to be carefully considered for practical deployment."

Since the formulation of information-theoretic concepts, it has evolved largely\nfor describing complex physical systems. One such important milestone was achieved by Yang\n1\narXiv:2601.19715v1  [math.ST]  27 Jan 2026\n\nand Qiu (2005) in decision theory through ﬁnding its use in modeling risky decisions by deﬁning\nan expected utility-entropy (EU-E)-based risk measure. The EU-E model incorporated the sub-\njective elements like decision makers’ attitudes towards risk or costs through an expected utility\nfunction and the objective uncertainty through the Shannon entropy function. The goal was to\nminimize the risk score measured in terms of the entropy and utility functions to identify the\nmost stable, rational, or appropriate decision given the available information about the action\nspace and the corresponding states of nature. Here, the risk is associated with the changes in the\nfuture value or cost of an asset or security, which an investor chooses to buy, due to ﬂuctuations\nin market conditions or other uncertain events.\nThe EU-E risk measure is based on the general decision-making model which is laid upon the\nfact that people choose an action with low uncertainty and high expected utility. It served as a\nnormative model of choosing proﬁtable actions or logical decisions and sometimes also served as\na descriptive model of economic behaviors. The general decision analysis model G = (Θ, A, ϑ)\ncomprises of the state space represented by Θ = {θ}, the action space symbolized by A and the\nutility function ϑ(X) representing an individual risk preference or risk aversion attitude. The\npayoﬀfunction deﬁned on the space A × Θ is denoted by X = X(a, θ).\nConsequently, when the action space A = {A1, A2, . . . , Al} and the state space θi corre-\nsponding to action Ai represented by θi = {θi1, θl2, . . . , θlmi} are considered to be ﬁnite, then we\nobtain a payoﬀX = X(Ai, θij) = xij corresponding to action Ai with state θij with θi having\na probability distribution {pij...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:15 | Backend: template*\n"

The main   feature of these distances is that they are invariant to renaming   the candidates and voters, and two elections are at distance zero if   and only if they are isomorphic. Specifically, we consider   isomorphic extensions of distances between preference orders: Given   such a distance d, we extend it to distance d-ID between   elections by unifying candidate names and finding a matching between   the votes, so that the sum of the d-distances between the matched   votes is as small as possible.

The main feature of these distances is that they are invariant to\nrenaming the candidates and voters, and two elections are at distance zero if and only if they\nare isomorphic. Specifically, we consider isomorphic extensions of distances between preference\norders: Given such a distance d, we extend it to distance d-ID between elections by unifying\ncandidate names and finding a matching between the votes, so that the sum of the d-distances\nbetween the matched votes is as small as possible.\nWe show that testing isomorphism of two elections can be done in polynomial time so, in\nprinciple, such distances can be tractable. Yet, we show that two very natural isomorphic distances\nare NP-complete and hard to approximate. We attempt to rectify the situation by showing FPT\nalgorithms for several natural parameterizations.\n1\nIntroduction\nWe consider the ordinal model of elections, where each voter submits a preference order that ranks\nthe candidates from the most to the least desirable one. Given two such elections of equal size—i.e.,\nwith the same numbers of candidates and the same numbers of voters, albeit where the names of the\ncandidates and voters may differ—we want to know how structurally similar they are.\nTo this end, we design distances that are invariant to renaming the candidates and voters, and\nwhich ensure that two elections are at distance zero if and only if they are isomorphic. We study the\ncomplexity of computing several such distances and seek ways of circumventing their intractability.\nOur starting point is the distance rationalizability framework [39, 35, 20, 19, 23], which also con-\nsiders distances over elections, but which assumes identical candidate and voter sets (for example,\none can think of elections with voters’ preferences at different points of time).\nOne approach from this framework is to take some metric d over preference orders (such as the\nswap distance, which counts the number of inversions) and extend it to elections by summing the\ndistances between the orders submitted by each voter in both elections.\n*Early version of this paper was presented at AAAI-2019 [28]. This version includes additional results and revised dis-\ncussions, taking into account follow-up works and the progress since that time.\n1\narXiv:2601.19716v1  [cs.GT]  27 Jan 2026\n\nWe adapt this idea, taking into account that the candidate and voter sets of the input elections\nmay be different (albeit, we crucially require equal numbers of candidates and equal numbers of\nvoters):\nWe first rename the candidates in one of the elections to be the same as in the other one, then\nwe match each voter from one election to a distinct voter in the other one, and finally we sum\nup the distances between the preference orders of the matched voters. Importantly, we rename the\ncandidates and match the voters in such a way as to minimize the final outcome. We refer to the\nthus-defined metric as the d-ISOMORPHIC DISTANCE (d-ID for short). Such distances indeed are\ninvariant to renaming the candidates and voters, and ensure that elections are at distance zero exactly\nif they are isomorphic.\nYet, it is natural to worry about the complexity of computing such distances because, irrespective\nof the choice of d, being able to compute d-ID implies the ability to decide if two elections are\nisomorphic. Fortunately, even though the complexity of testing isomorphism of many mathematical\nobjects is elusive (where the case of GRAPH ISOMORPHISM is by far the most famous example;\nsee, e.g., the report of Babai ...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

The result is consistent with RGZ correlator-based infrared moment analyses\nand with lattice expectations, providing a cross-check of RGZ-inspired infrared gluodynamics from\na bound-state viewpoint.\nI.\nINTRODUCTION\nUnderstanding the emergence of a physical, colorless spectrum from nonabelian YM theory [1] remains an important\nproblem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A paradigmatic manifestation of confinement is the expected existence\nof glueballs, i.e. bound states with purely gluonic valence content. Although lattice simulations provide robust evidence\nfor a discrete glueball spectrum in pure gauge theories, connecting these results to continuum frameworks that remain\nanalytically controllable in the infrared (IR) is still a highly nontrivial task.\nIn continuum formulations, a gauge choice is required, and the standard Faddeev–Popov (FP)\n[2] procedure is\nincomplete in the IR due to the presence of Gribov copies [3, 4]. In the Landau gauge, large-volume lattice simulations\nhave long established a decoupling-type gluon propagator: the transverse propagator saturates to a finite nonzero\nvalue as p2 →0 while violating reflection positivity [5–8].\nThis behavior strongly suggests that the relevant IR\ndegrees of freedom are not particle-like gluons, and that physical information must be extracted from gauge-invariant\ncomposite operators.\nA prominent continuum strategy to incorporate the Gribov problem while preserving locality and renormalizability\nis the GZ framework [9, 10], and its Refined version (RGZ), where dimension-two condensates introduce additional\nIR mass scales that bring YM correlators in quantitative agreement with lattice data in the Landau gauge over a\nbroad momentum window [11, 12]. An especially powerful formulation of RGZ employs the gauge-invariant transverse\nfield Ah\nµ, which enables one to retain an exact nilpotent BRST symmetry (in particular in linear covariant gauges),\nthereby ensuring a controlled renormalization of gauge-invariant composite operators and the associated Ward/Nielsen\nidentities [13–15]. The resulting RGZ gluon propagator is IR-finite and typically exhibits complex conjugate poles, a\nconcise analytic imprint of positivity violation and confinement.\nA complementary continuum route, conceptually closer to lattice gauge fixing, is based on lifting the Gribov\ndegeneracy by averaging over Gribov copies with a tunable weight in the Landau gauge.\nThis was proposed by\nJ. Serreau and M. Tissier and further work collaborators developed in covariant extensions and replica/superspace\nformulations [16–18]. In this approach, a replica nonlinear sigma-model sector induces a radiatively generated screening\nmass for the gluon through a phenomenon akin to symmetry restoration in the two-dimensional nonlinear sigma\nmodel, yielding an IR-safe perturbative description in a finite domain of renormalized parameters (without an IR\nLandau pole at one loop) [18]. More recently, our unified Landau-gauge fixing has been proposed that continuously\ninterpolates between the Serreau–Tissier (ST) copy-averaged formulation and the RGZ restriction to the first Gribov\nregion, by combining copy averaging with a horizon suppression in a single local, BRST-invariant ...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

Although such surveys are an essential source of evidence for population\nhealth monitoring, the resulting data are inherently subject to sampling variability and mul-\ntiple forms of measurement error (see, among others, Schenker et al., 2010; Ramo et al.,\n2011). Self-reported behavioral outcomes are particularly prone to recall bias, rounding, and\nsystematic digit preference, all of which can distort descriptive analysis and both design- and\n1\narXiv:2601.19729v1  [stat.ME]  27 Jan 2026\n\nmodel-based inference. Furthermore, survey sample sizes are often insufficient to produce re-\nliable estimates for small geographic domains or specific socio-demographic groups, thereby\nmotivating the development and use of statistical techniques capable of “borrowing strength”\nacross areas.\nThis study focuses on tobacco consumption, a leading modifiable risk factor for which\nreliable and geographically disaggregated measures are essential for monitoring population\nhealth. To this end, we use data from the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), coor-\ndinated by Eurostat, focusing on the Italian 2019 component. The key indicators considered\nin the analysis are computed from the variable “mean number of cigarettes smoked daily”\nand are potentially affected by data coarsening in self-reports, which reduces the effective\nresolution of the observed data. In particular, we focus on estimating the proportion of daily\nsmokers, the average daily number of cigarettes smoked among daily smokers, and the pro-\nportion of heavy smokers among daily smokers. Furthermore, a key objective of this work\nis to produce estimates at the regional level and further disaggregated by age group, which\nexacerbates the problem of limited sample sizes in several domains.\nProducing reliable regional and age-specific estimates is important for informing targeted\npublic health policies and resource allocation (Kong and Zhang, 2020; Flor et al., 2021).\nFrom a statistical perspective, it also highlights why standard direct estimators, that i...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

The authors systematically evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs across nine real-world product categories on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks.\n\nThe key findings are: 1) While MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, they struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel-level alignment. 2) Performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, with no trivial correlation between model size and performance. 3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Introduction of MMPCBench, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on missing modality completion in e-commerce product catalogs.\n2. Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs on image-to-text and text-to-image completion tasks across nine product categories.\n3. Exploration of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with the missing modality completion task.\n4. Insights into the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation for e-commerce applications.\n5. Establishment of a baseline for future research on missing modality completion in product catalogs.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe authors formulate the missing modality completion task as generating either an image or a textual description given the available counterpart modality (text or image) for a product. They evaluate MLLMs on this task using the proposed MMPCBench, which consists of two sub-benchmarks: a Content Quality Completion Benchmark and a Recommendation Benchmark.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nThe authors evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs from the Qwen2.5-VL and Gemma-3 model families, which are inherently capable of integrating textual and visual contexts and generating missing components.\n\n### Training/Optimization (if applicable)\nThe authors explore Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to better align MLLMs with the missing modality completion task.\n\n## Key Results\n- MLLMs struggle with fine-grained word-level and pixel-level alignment in missing modality completion, despite capturing high-level semantics.\n- Performance varies substantially across product categories and model scales, with no trivial correlation between model size and performance.\n- GRPO improves image-to-text completion but does not yield gains for text-to-image completion.\n\n## Strengths\n- Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on a real-world task.\n- Exploration of a novel optimization technique (GRPO) for improving MLLM performance.\n- Insights into the limitations of current MLLMs in cross-modal generation.\n- Establishment of a benchmark for future research in this area.\n\n## Limitations\n- Evaluation is limited to product images and textual descriptions, excluding other modalities or attributes.\n- Potential data leakage issues due to pre-training of MLLMs on earlier versions of the dataset.\n- Lack of comparison with classical or non-MLLM baselines for missing modality completion.\n- No analysis of the impact of different MLLM architectures or pre-training strategies.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe authors state that they use the most recent version of the Amazon Review Dataset (released in March 2024) to mitigate potential data leakage. However, no specific information is provided regarding the availability of code or data.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe work highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in real-world cross-modal generation tasks, specifically for e-commerce product catalogs. While MLLMs can capture high-level semantics, their struggle with fine-grained alignment and the lack of correlation between model size and performance suggest that further research is needed to improve their effectiveness in this domain.\n\nThe proposed MMPCBench benchmark and the insights gained from this study can facilitate future research in missing modality completion for product catalogs, potentially leading to improved user experiences and downstream applications in e-commerce platforms.\n\nHowever, the authors acknowledge the potential for data leakage due to pre-training on earlier versions of the dataset, which could impact the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, the exclusion of other modalities or attributes and the lack of comparison with classical or non-MLLM baselines limit the scope of the study.\n\nOverall, this work represents an important step towards more effective missing modality completion in e-commerce scenarios, but further research is needed to address the identified limitations and explore alternative approaches or architectures."

Wolfert∗\nDepartment of Algorithmics, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science\nDelft University of Technology, The Netherlands\nAbstract\nPreference aggregation is a core operation in multi-objective design optimisation and\ngroup decision-making, as it determines the best-fit-for-common-purpose alternative\nwithin complex socio-technical contexts. Since preferences are intrinsically linked to\nchoice, they are subjective, inherently contextual, and reflect humans’ free will to\nrelatively order their alternatives.\nTherefore, their aggregation requires a rigorous\nmeasurement-theoretic foundation to ensure mathematical validity, interpretability,\nand uniqueness.\nBarzilai’s Preference Function Modelling (PFM) theory provides a formal foundation\nby treating preferences as elements of a one-dimensional affine space, where only dif-\nferences are meaningful. PFM establishes the principal axioms of unique preference\naggregation, providing a rigorous basis on which aggregation can be demonstrated.\nIn this paper, these theoretical conditions are applied to construct a linear preference\nspace with commensurability across multiple criteria, a stable zero-referenced interval\nscale, and uniqueness up to affine transformation, enabling consistent preference aggre-\ngation. It is shown that only linear aggregation—a weighted centroid of z-scores—is\nadmissible. Analytical arguments and illustrative examples demonstrate that this ap-\nproach produces a unique aggregated preference ranking. Moreover, this work shows\nthat commonly used aggregation approaches in MCDM—such as weighted arithmetic\nand geometric means, as well as weighted distance-based optimisation methods—often\nfail to produce consistent rankings and are therefore unsuitable for pure MCDM. In\ncontrast, the unique preference aggregation presented here clarifies the mathematical\nlimits of valid aggregation and provides a principled, implementable foundation for ro-\nbust multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and multi-objective design optimisation\n(MODO) in multi-faceted problems.\nKeywords: Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM); Preference Aggregation; Design and\nDecision Systems; Multi-criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA); Multi-objective Design Opti-\nmization (MODO); Preference Function Modelling (PFM)\nArticle history:\nCompiled January 26, 2026\n∗Corresponding author: A.R.M.

A preference expresses the relative de-\nsirability, value, or utility of a design alternative or decision option Ai with respect to a\ncriterion Cj. Everything of value is relative. Each alternative or option is intuitively eval-\nuated against one’s conscious lived experience — a relative, subjective, and open-ended\nhuman perception arising from all the outer and inner senses. Preference is not a physical\nproperty but a subjective construct of the mind. It represents an individual’s choice — free\nwill — within the set of available options, defining the decision space from which selections\nare made. Free will cannot be absolutely measured, because it is not an object of thought\nbut a reality expressed through human willing; what is possible is ordering and comparison,\nin which preference emerges as a relative expression of value. Preference is inherently con-\ntextual — it reflects the free ordering of alternatives within a given situation. It is therefore\nindividual, relational and situation-dependent.\nConsequently, preference is ’synonymous’ with choice: a binary relation that induces\nchoice, as one selects the alternative one prefers over another: i.e., A1 ≻A2. Without dif-\nference, no decision — only difference sets willing into motion. Preference scores or ratings\nare points whose meaning is inherently relational, as ...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

Implementation and benchmarking of Violaris' inter-branch message-transfer protocol on multiple IBM superconducting quantum processors.\n2. Evaluation of three message families (sparse, half-weight, and dense) to study the impact of message structure on performance.\n3. Analysis of conditional string success probability, memory erasure, branch contrast, and bitwise mutual information as performance metrics.\n4. Investigation of scaling behavior, compilation variability, and branch-amplitude sweeps to characterize noise and coherence limits.\n5. Release of all data and figure-generation scripts for reproducibility.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe authors implement Violaris' unitary message-transfer primitive, which enables the transfer of classical messages between branches in a Wigner's-friend circuit. They benchmark this protocol on IBM's Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3) superconducting quantum processors for message sizes up to 32 qubits, without error mitigation.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nThe study evaluates the performance of the message-transfer protocol on three different IBM quantum processor architectures: Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3). These architectures represent different generations and design choices, allowing for a comparative analysis of their capabilities.\n\n## Key Results\n(Include specific metrics in a table if possible)\n\n| Metric | Description | Key Findings |\n|--------|--------------|--------------|\n| Conditional string success probability ($p_{\\mathrm{all}}$) | Probability of correctly recovering the message given a specific branch | For sparse messages at $n=32$, $p_{\\mathrm{all}}$ ranged from 0.07 to 0.68 across backends, demonstrating the impact of device noise. |\n| Memory erasure | Ability to erase the message from the quantum state after uncomputation | Evaluated but specific results not provided. |\n| Branch contrast | Measure of the distinguishability between branches | Used as a correlation diagnostic. |\n| Bitwise mutual information | Measure of the correlation between individual bits in the message and the branch | Used as a correlation diagnostic. |\n\n## Strengths\n- Comprehensive benchmark of a practical quantum protocol on multiple hardware architectures.\n- Evaluation of different message families to understand the impact of message structure.\n- Analysis of scaling behavior, compilation variability, and branch-amplitude sweeps to characterize noise and coherence limits.\n- Release of all data and code for reproducibility.\n\n## Limitations\n- Limited to IBM's superconducting quantum processors, which may not generalize to other hardware platforms.\n- No error mitigation techniques were employed, which could potentially improve performance.\n- Specific results for memory erasure and correlation diagnostics were not provided in detail.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe authors have released all raw results (CSV files) and scripts required to reproduce the figures in a reproducibility bundle accompanying the manuscript. The bundle also includes calibration snapshots to support full provenance.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis work provides a comprehensive benchmark for inter-branch message transfer, a fundamental primitive in quantum communication and computation. By evaluating the performance of this protocol across multiple hardware architectures and message families, the authors offer insights into the noise characteristics, compilation variability, and coherence limits of near-term superconducting quantum processors. These findings can guide the development of more robust quantum algorithms, error mitigation strategies, and future hardware designs. Additionally, the release of all data and code enhances the reproducibility and transparency of the research, promoting further advancements in the field."

This has motivated incremental stochastic estimation methods, including the incremental stochastic Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm formulated via stochastic approximation. In this work, we revisit and analyze an incremental stochastic variant of the Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm, which generalizes incremental stochastic EM as a special case. Our approach relaxes key EM requirements, such as explicit latent-variable representations, enabling broader applicability and greater algorithmic flexibility. We establish theoretical guarantees for the incremental stochastic MM algorithm, proving consistency in the sense that the iterates converge to a stationary point characterized by a vanishing gradient of the objective. We demonstrate these advantages on a softmax-gated mixture of experts (MoE) regression problem, for which no stochastic EM algorithm is available. Empirically, our method consistently outperforms widely used stochastic optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent, root mean square propagation, adaptive moment estimation, and second-order clipped stochastic optimization. These results support the development of new incremental stochastic algorithms, given the central role of softmax-gated MoE architectures in contemporary deep neural networks for heterogeneous data modeling. Beyond synthetic experiments, we also validate practical effectiveness on two real-world datasets, including a bioinformatics study of dent maize genotypes under drought stress that integrates high-dimensional proteomics with ecophysiological traits, where incremental stochastic MM yields stable gains in predictive performance.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: The paper focuses on stochastic optimization algorithms with limited direct connection to quality engineering's Y=R+S+N decomposition framework.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: incremental stochastic optimization, majorization-minimization, mixture of experts, convergence analysis\n\nRationale:\n- While the paper discusses optimization techniques, it does not explicitly address quality engineering principles\n- No direct mention of reliability (R), sensitivity (S), or noise (N) decomposition\n- The technical focus is on machine learning algorithm development rather than quality system analysis\n- Minimal overlap with YRSN's core methodological approach to understanding system performance variation\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:51 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

However, unlike classical numerical methods that offer established convergence guarantees, neural network-based approximations typically lack rigorous error bounds. Furthermore, the non-deterministic nature of their optimization makes it difficult to mathematically certify their accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a \"Learn and Verify\" framework that provides computable, mathematically rigorous error bounds for the solutions of differential equations. By combining a novel Doubly Smoothed Maximum (DSM) loss for training with interval arithmetic for verification, we compute rigorous a posteriori error bounds as machine-verifiable proofs. Numerical experiments on nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), including problems with time-varying coefficients and finite-time blow-up, demonstrate that the proposed framework successfully constructs rigorous enclosures of the true solutions, establishing a foundation for trustworthy scientific machine learning.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: While the paper addresses verification and error bounds for neural networks solving differential equations, it does not directly relate to the YRSN quality engineering decomposition framework.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: physics-informed neural networks, error bounds, verification, interval arithmetic, scientific machine learning\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:53 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: While the paper involves multimodal reasoning and interaction, it does not directly address the YRSN context quality engineering framework or Y=R+S+N decomposition.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: multimodal reasoning, audio-visual interaction, query-guided feature extraction, frequency domain analysis\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:54 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

Conventional physics-based models struggle to capture the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation during transient events like rapid acceleration. While deep neural networks can learn these relationships from data, monolithic architectures like MLPs and LSTMs often require large, computationally expensive models to perform well.\n\nThe proposed JEPA framework overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics in a structured latent space. It learns to encode only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation from a rich dataset combining real-world driving data and high-frequency test bench measurements. This results in superior data efficiency, predictive accuracy across diverse transients, and stronger generalization compared to LSTM baselines.\n\nTo enable real-world deployment, the authors apply structured pruning and post-training quantization, drastically reducing the model's computational footprint with negligible accuracy loss. The resulting highly efficient model is well-suited for on-board implementation of advanced emission control strategies in conventional and hybrid powertrains.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. A novel Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) framework for modeling transient engine emissions in a structured latent space.\n2. Leveraging a rich dataset combining real-world and test bench data to learn a compact, robust representation of emission dynamics.\n3. Demonstrating superior data efficiency, predictive accuracy, and generalization compared to LSTM baselines.\n4. Applying structured pruning and quantization to enable highly efficient on-board deployment with minimal accuracy loss.\n5. Providing a pathway towards robust, real-time emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach is to model transient engine emission dynamics in a structured latent space using the proposed Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) framework. This involves learning a compact, robust representation that encodes only the key factors governing emission behavior from a rich dataset.\n\n### Architecture\nThe JEPA framework consists of an encoder network that maps input features to a low-dimensional latent space, and a decoder network that predicts emission outputs from the latent representation. The latent space is structured to capture the relevant factors influencing emission formation.\n\n### Training/Optimization\nThe JEPA framework is trained end-to-end using a combined dataset of real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data and high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The authors likely employ standard techniques for training deep neural networks, such as stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation.\n\n## Key Results\n- The JEPA framework outperformed high-performing LSTM baselines in predictive accuracy and generalization across diverse transient regimes.\n- Structured pruning and post-training quantization reduced the model's computational footprint by X% (specific metrics not provided) with negligible accuracy loss.\n\n## Strengths\n- Novel approach to modeling complex emission dynamics in a structured latent space.\n- Leverages rich, diverse data sources for improved representation learning.\n- Demonstrates superior data efficiency, accuracy, and generalization compared to conventional architectures.\n- Enables highly efficient on-board deployment through pruning and quantization.\n- Provides a clear pathway towards improved emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.\n\n## Limitations\n- Specific architecture details and hyperparameters are not provided, limiting reproducibility.\n- Quantitative results and comparisons to baselines are not comprehensively reported.\n- The impact of different data sources (PEMS vs. test bench) on model performance is not analyzed.\n- Real-world deployment and integration with control systems are not demonstrated.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe authors do not explicitly mention the availability of code or data used in this work.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis work presents a promising approach to accurately modeling transient engine emissions, a critical challenge in optimizing powertrain systems for improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. By leveraging rich data sources and a novel latent space framework, the proposed JEPA model demonstrates superior performance and generalization compared to conventional architectures.\n\nThe ability to efficiently deploy the model on-board vehicles through pruning and quantization techniques is a significant step towards enabling advanced predictive control strategies for real-time emission mitigation. This could lead to cleaner, more efficient powertrains and accelerate the development of next-generation hybrid and electric vehicles.\n\nHowever, the lack of specific implementation details, comprehensive results, and real-world deployment demonstrations limits the immediate impact and reproducibility of this work. Further validation and integration with control systems would be necessary to fully realize the potential of this approach in practical applications.\n\nOverall, this paper presents a promising direction for improving emission modeling and control, with potential implications for reducing the environmental footprint of transportation systems and enabling more sustainable mobility solutions."

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: A Folded Surface Code Architecture for 2D Quantum Hardware\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel quantum error correction architecture that leverages qubit shuttling to implement folded surface codes on two-dimensional quantum hardware. The authors build upon Cai et al.'s (2023) shuttling-based architecture that creates effective three-dimensional connectivity on 2D devices, combining it with recent advances in transversal gate implementations for surface codes. The key innovation is enabling native implementation of folded surface codes that support transversal execution of all single-qubit logical Clifford gates (H, S) and logical CNOTs, dramatically reducing their runtime from O(d) to constant time compared to conventional lattice surgery approaches.\n\nThe work addresses a critical bottleneck in quantum error correction where logical gate operations typically require expensive lattice surgery protocols. By exploiting the quasi-3D structure created through shuttling loops and careful pipelining, the authors demonstrate how to perform these operations transversally within the folded surface code framework. They also introduce a \"virtual-stack\" layout optimization and show significant improvements in magic-state distillation protocols, particularly for the 8T-to-CCZ conversion which sees more than an order of magnitude reduction in spacetime volume.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Native folded surface code implementation** on 2D hardware using shuttling-based quasi-3D connectivity\n2. **Constant-time logical Clifford gates** (H, S, CNOT) through transversal implementation, eliminating O(d) lattice surgery overhead\n3. **Explicit protocols** for all single-qubit logical Clifford operations in the folded architecture\n4. **Dramatic improvement in magic-state distillation** with >10× reduction in spacetime volume for 8T-to-CCZ conversion\n5. **Virtual-stack layout design** for more efficient exploitation of the quasi-3D structure\n6. **Multilayer routing capabilities** on 2D devices through the new layout approach\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe core approach combines three key elements: (1) the shuttling-based architecture from Cai et al. that creates effective 3D connectivity through shuttling loops and pipelining, (2) recent advances in transversal gate schemes for rotated surface codes that exploit temporary transitions to unrotated surface code patches, and (3) the folded surface code framework that enables transversal implementations of all Clifford gates.\n\nThe architecture utilizes both inter-loop and intra-loop qubit interactions, where qubits can be shuttled within loops for local operations and between loops for non-local connectivity. The folded surface code is implemented by carefully mapping the logical qubit structure across multiple layers of the quasi-3D system, enabling transversal gate operations that would otherwise require expensive lattice surgery in conventional 2D implementations.\n\n## Results\n\n- **Runtime improvement**: Logical Clifford gates reduced from O(d) to constant time\n- **Magic-state distillation**: >10× reduction in spacetime volume for 8T-to-CCZ conversion compared to standard 2D lattice surgery\n- **Transversal gate access**: All single-qubit Clifford gates (H, S) and logical CNOTs can be performed transversally\n- **Layout efficiency**: Virtual-stack design enables more efficient multilayer routing on 2D devices\n- **Scalability**: Architecture maintains scalable 3D connectivity on strictly 2D hardware platforms\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Significant practical impact** - Addresses a major bottleneck in quantum error correction by eliminating expensive lattice surgery for common logical operations\n• **Platform versatility** - Applicable to multiple leading quantum computing platforms including trapped-ion, neutral-atom, and semiconductor spin qubits\n• **Concrete implementation** - Provides explicit protocols rather than just theoretical frameworks, making the approach practically implementable\n• **Comprehensive optimization** - Covers both gate-level improvements and system-level layout optimizations through the virtual-stack design\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Hardware requirements** - Relies on sophisticated shuttling capabilities that may not be available on all platforms or may introduce additional noise and complexity\n• **Limited experimental validation** - The paper appears to be primarily theoretical without experimental demonstration of the proposed protocols\n• **Shuttling overhead** - While logical gate times are reduced, the paper doesn't fully account for the time and fidelity costs of the required shuttling operations\n• **Scalability constraints** - The quasi-3D structure may face practical limitations in terms of shuttling speed, loop size, and coordination complexity at very large scales\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work represents a significant advancement in quantum error correction architecture design, particularly for platforms with shuttling capabilities. The ability to perform logical Clifford gates in constant time rather than O(d) time could dramatically improve the efficiency of quantum algorithms, especially those requiring frequent logical operations. The substantial improvement in magic-state distillation efficiency is particularly valuable given the central role of magic states in universal quantum computation.\n\nThe research bridges theoretical advances in surface code implementations with practical architectural considerations, potentially accelerating the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers on trapped-ion, neutral-atom, and semiconductor platforms. However, the practical impact will depend heavily on the successful implementation of the required shuttling protocols and their noise characteristics in real devices. The work opens important avenues for future research in shuttling-based quantum architectures and could influence the design of next-generation quantum computing systems.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:51 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

The authors highlight the challenges of applying traditional recommender systems to healthcare, such as lack of public data, need for interpretability, and high stakes involved. Their model leverages the structure of psychometric questionnaire data to provide visual explanations for recommendations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by healthcare professionals.\n\nThe proposed approach is evaluated on healthcare datasets collected in Brazil, with a focus on assisting professionals in creating personalized care plans for elderly patients. The results suggest the model can advance the application of recommender systems in gerontological primary care, an area expected to grow due to demographic changes.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1.

Application to gerontological primary care for personalized care plan recommendations\n4. Empirical evaluation on real healthcare datasets from Brazil\n5. User study assessing interpretability of generated visual explanations\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach involves learning a multi-label classification model from psychometric questionnaire data to predict the most relevant aspects of care for a patient based on their responses to a subset of questions. The model provides visual explanations by highlighting the specific questions and responses that most influenced each recommended aspect.\n\n### Architecture \nThe model architecture is not explicitly described, but it appears to be a multi-label classification model trained on psychometric data using supervised learning.\n\n### Training/Optimization\nDetails on the training procedure and optimization are not provided. The model is likely trained using standard multi-label classification objectives and optimizers.\n\n## Key Results\nSpecific quantitative results are not included in the abstract. The paper mentions comparative offline performance evaluation against other methods as well as a user study evaluating the interpretability of the visual explanations generated by the proposed model.\n\n## Strengths\n- Addresses important challenges in healthcare recommender systems (data scarcity, interpretability, high stakes)\n- Novel approach tailored for psychometric questionnaire data structure\n- Provides interpretable visual explanations for recommendations\n- Focused on an important application area (gerontological primary care)\n- Evaluated on real-world healthcare datasets and interpretability user study\n\n## Limitations\n- Lack of technical details on model architecture and training procedure\n- No quantitative results reported in the abstract\n- Limited generalizability beyond psychometric questionnaire data\n- Potential concerns around privacy and ethics of healthcare data usage\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe abstract does not mention the availability of code or data.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nIf successful, the proposed recommendation model could have a significant positive impact by enabling more personalized and interpretable care plans for elderly patients in primary care settings. This could improve health outcomes and quality of care, especially as populations continue to age globally. However, the work's impact may be limited to the specific healthcare niche studied due to the tailored approach. Broader deployment would require addressing data privacy, ethics, and generalizability concerns."

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: Routing End User Queries to Enterprise Databases\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper addresses the practical challenge of routing natural language queries to appropriate databases in multi-database enterprise environments. The authors identify significant limitations in existing benchmarks for database routing tasks, particularly the unrealistic repository sizes and skewed distributions that fail to capture real-world enterprise scenarios where multiple databases often overlap in domain coverage.\n\nThe work makes two primary contributions: constructing more realistic benchmarks by extending existing NL-to-SQL datasets (Spider and BirdSQL), and proposing a novel training-free routing method that combines schema entity recognition with large language models. The authors reformulate the experimental setup to create unified database repositories with fair train-test splits, addressing the counter-intuitive performance patterns observed in prior work where cross-domain settings unexpectedly outperformed in-domain settings.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Realistic Benchmark Construction**: Development of Spider-Route and Bird-Route datasets that merge train/test databases into unified repositories, creating more realistic enterprise-like scenarios with domain-overlapping databases.\n\n2. **Improved Experimental Framework**: Introduction of a fairer evaluation setup with 50-50 query splits within each database, ensuring identical repositories across in-domain and cross-domain settings.\n\n3. **Novel Training-Free Routing Method**: A modular, reasoning-driven reranking strategy that explicitly models schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment.\n\n4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Demonstration that the proposed method consistently outperforms embedding-only and direct LLM-prompting baselines across multiple metrics.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe core approach appears to be a training-free method that combines multiple reasoning components, though the paper excerpt doesn't provide complete methodological details. The approach seems to involve:\n\n- **Schema Entity Recognition**: Identifying relevant schema elements from natural language queries\n- **Multi-faceted Scoring**: Explicit modeling of schema coverage, structural connectivity, and semantic alignment\n- **LLM Integration**: Leveraging large language models for reasoning-based reranking\n- **Modular Design**: A reranking strategy that can be applied without requiring supervised training\n\nThe methodology addresses the dynamic nature of enterprise database schemas where frequent fine-tuning would be impractical.\n\n## Results\n\nBased on the available information:\n- The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the constructed benchmarks\n- Consistent improvements across all evaluated metrics compared to baseline approaches\n- Re-implementation of prior techniques shows inferior performance on the new realistic benchmarks, demonstrating increased difficulty\n- The method successfully handles both in-domain and cross-domain routing scenarios\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Addresses Real-World Problem**: Tackles a genuine enterprise challenge with practical implications for database query routing systems\n\n• **Improved Benchmark Design**: Creates more realistic evaluation scenarios that better reflect enterprise environments with overlapping database domains\n\n• **Training-Free Approach**: Develops a method that doesn't require supervised training, making it more practical for dynamic enterprise environments\n\n• **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides detailed qualitative analysis and addresses limitations of existing benchmarks with concrete solutions\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Incomplete Methodological Details**: The paper excerpt lacks sufficient technical depth about the specific algorithms and implementation details of the proposed approach\n\n• **Limited Scope**: Focuses only on relational databases, while enterprises typically use diverse data sources including knowledge graphs and document repositories\n\n• **Evaluation Constraints**: Despite improvements, the benchmark is still derived from existing NL-to-SQL datasets which may not fully capture enterprise query complexity and diversity\n\n• **Scalability Questions**: Unclear how the approach performs with very large database repositories typical in major enterprise environments\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work addresses a significant gap in database routing research by providing more realistic benchmarks and evaluation frameworks. The training-free approach has practical value for enterprise deployments where database schemas change frequently. However, the impact may be limited by the scope restriction to relational databases and the reliance on existing NL-to-SQL datasets for benchmark construction.\n\nThe research establishes a foundation for more realistic evaluation of database routing systems and provides a practical solution that could be deployed in enterprise environments. Future work could expand beyond relational databases to include the full spectrum of enterprise data sources and develop even more comprehensive benchmarks that capture the true complexity of enterprise query routing scenarios.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:50 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

As a result, multi-hop QA is a direct stress test of a model’s abil-\nity to manage cognitive load, control deliberation, and integrate retrieval with reasoning (Adapala, 2025).\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a central strategy to reduce reliance on paramet-\nric memory by grounding generation in external evidence (Lewis et al., 2020). Yet most evaluations treat\nretrieval as a static preprocessing step, followed by one-shot generation over a fixed context. Recent work\nargues that advanced RAG algorithms, such as iterative or dynamic RAG, can outperform static pipelines\nby progressively focusing the evidence set and correcting course mid-chain (Gao et al., 2025).\nThis strategy supports multi-hop QA in two complementary ways: (i) reasoning-augment...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:01 by YRSN Research Monitor (rule-based)*\n*Tip: Set AWS credentials or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for LLM-powered analysis*\n"

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: Neural Neural Scaling Laws\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper introduces Neural Neural Scaling Laws (NeuNeu), a neural network-based approach to predict downstream task performance of language models as they scale. The authors argue that traditional parametric scaling laws, which rely on aggregate validation loss metrics, suffer from two key limitations: (1) averaging token-level losses obscures important signals, and (2) no single parametric family can capture the diverse scaling behaviors observed across different downstream tasks (monotonic improvement, plateauing, or even degradation with scale).\n\nNeuNeu frames scaling law prediction as a time-series extrapolation problem, combining temporal context from observed accuracy trajectories with token-level validation losses. The model is designed to be invariant across model scales by abstracting training steps into relative compute intervals and converting losses to token probabilities. Trained on open-source model checkpoints from HuggingFace, NeuNeu demonstrates significant improvements over traditional logistic scaling laws, achieving 2.04% mean absolute error compared to 3.29% for parametric approaches—a 38% reduction in prediction error.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Novel neural approach to scaling laws**: First work to use neural networks for predicting downstream task performance scaling, moving beyond parametric power-law relationships\n2. **Token-level loss integration**: Incorporates fine-grained token-level validation losses rather than relying solely on aggregate metrics\n3. **Scale-invariant design**: Develops input representations that generalize across different model families and parameter counts\n4. **Comprehensive empirical validation**: Demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen model families, parameter counts, and downstream tasks\n5. **Significant performance improvement**: Achieves 38% reduction in prediction error compared to logistic scaling laws across 66 downstream tasks\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe core approach treats scaling law prediction as time-series extrapolation using a transformer-based neural network. The architecture combines:\n\n- **Temporal context**: Historical accuracy trajectories from observed training checkpoints\n- **Token-level losses**: Fine-grained validation loss distributions rather than averaged metrics\n- **Scale-invariant inputs**: Training steps normalized to relative compute intervals and losses converted to token probabilities\n- **Transformer architecture**: Processes sequential training data to predict future performance points\n\nThe model is trained on trajectories from open-source language models on HuggingFace, learning patterns in training dynamics that are decoupled from specific training configurations. This design enables generalization across different model scales and architectures.\n\n## Results\n\n- **Primary metric**: 2.04% mean absolute error (MAE) on 66 downstream tasks vs. 3.29% for logistic scaling laws (38% improvement)\n- **Generalization testing**: Successful zero-shot performance on four held-out conditions: new random seeds, pretraining datasets (C4), model families (Pythia), and unseen downstream tasks\n- **Task-specific performance**: Consistent improvements across diverse tasks including ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, MMLU, and others\n- **Baseline comparisons**: Outperforms multiple baselines including LC-PFN, DiffProbe, and various ablation models\n- **Cross-architecture validation**: Demonstrates generalization to Pythia models with parameter counts (70M, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B) outside the training distribution\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Addresses fundamental limitations**: Tackles real problems with existing parametric approaches that struggle with diverse scaling behaviors\n• **Strong empirical validation**: Comprehensive evaluation across multiple dimensions of generalization with consistent improvements\n• **Practical applicability**: Trained entirely on publicly available data, making the approach reproducible and accessible\n• **Novel technical approach**: Creative framing of scaling laws as time-series prediction with well-motivated architectural choices\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Limited methodological details**: The paper excerpt lacks sufficient detail about the transformer architecture, training procedures, and hyperparameter choices\n• **Computational overhead**: Neural approach likely requires more computation than simple parametric fits, though this cost-benefit analysis is not discussed\n• **Training data dependency**: Performance may be limited by the diversity and quality of available open-source training trajectories\n• **Evaluation scope**: While 66 tasks is substantial, the generalization claims would benefit from evaluation on a broader range of model families and training regimes\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work represents a significant methodological advance in scaling law research, moving from rigid parametric assumptions to flexible data-driven approaches. The 38% improvement in prediction accuracy could have substantial practical implications for resource allocation and model development planning in the language modeling community. The zero-shot generalization capabilities are particularly valuable, as they suggest the approach could be applied to new model families without retraining.\n\nThe broader impact extends beyond immediate performance gains—this work demonstrates that complex scaling behaviors can be learned directly from data rather than assumed through parametric forms. This could inspire similar neural approaches in other areas of ML where scaling relationships are important. However, the practical adoption will depend on the computational overhead and the continued availability of diverse open-source training trajectories for model updates.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 11:13 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: Information-Theoretic Detection of Bimanual Interactions for Dual-Arm Robot Plan Generation\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel approach to programming dual-arm robotic systems through single RGB video demonstrations of bimanual tasks. The authors address a significant gap in programming by demonstration (PbD) literature, where bimanual coordination has been underexplored due to the complexity of capturing and analyzing hand coordination patterns. The proposed method leverages Shannon's information theory to detect coordination policies between hands by analyzing information flow between scene elements, ultimately generating modular behavior trees for robot execution.\n\nThe work tackles the practical challenge of making robot programming more accessible to non-experts while specifically focusing on the coordination complexities inherent in bimanual tasks. By using only RGB video input and applying information-theoretic principles to scene graph analysis, the authors aim to simplify the demonstration process compared to traditional kinesthetic teaching or complex motion capture systems that require specialized equipment and expertise.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Novel information-theoretic framework** for detecting bimanual coordination patterns from single RGB video demonstrations\n2. **One-shot learning approach** that generates execution plans from a single demonstration video\n3. **Modular behavior tree generation** that adapts structure based on detected arm coordination requirements\n4. **Open-source dataset** of multi-subject bimanual task demonstrations for community use\n5. **Scene graph-based analysis** leveraging information flow properties for coordination detection\n\n## Methodology\n\n**Note**: The provided paper excerpt appears incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence in the methodology section. Based on the available content:\n\n**Core Approach**: The method processes single RGB videos of bimanual demonstrations using Shannon's information theory to analyze information flow between scene elements. The system constructs scene graphs and applies information-theoretic measures to detect coordination patterns between hands and objects.\n\n**Architecture**: The framework generates modular behavior trees that can assume different structures based on the detected coordination requirements. The system appears to use computer vision techniques for scene understanding combined with graph-based representations for capturing spatial and temporal relationships.\n\n**Pipeline**: The approach involves video processing, scene graph construction, information flow analysis, coordination pattern detection, and behavior tree generation for dual-arm robot execution.\n\n## Results\n\n**Note**: Specific quantitative results are not provided in the available excerpt. The abstract mentions:\n\n- Validation through multiple subject video demonstrations\n- Comparison with existing methods showing \"significant improvements\"\n- Testing on both collected dataset and external publicly available data\n- Demonstrated effectiveness in generating centralized execution plans for two-arm coordination\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Practical accessibility**: Uses only RGB video input, eliminating need for specialized motion capture equipment or kinesthetic teaching setups\n• **Theoretical foundation**: Applies well-established information theory principles to a novel robotics problem\n• **Modular design**: Behavior tree approach allows flexible adaptation to different coordination requirements\n• **Community contribution**: Provides open-source dataset for future research in bimanual robotics\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Single demonstration dependency**: One-shot approach may not capture task variability or handle failure cases effectively\n• **Limited technical details**: Incomplete methodology section prevents full assessment of technical approach\n• **Evaluation scope**: Unclear how the method handles complex coordination patterns or scales to diverse bimanual tasks\n• **Robustness concerns**: No discussion of performance under varying lighting conditions, camera angles, or occlusions typical in RGB-only systems\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work addresses an important and underexplored area in robotics by making bimanual robot programming more accessible through vision-based demonstration. The information-theoretic approach represents a novel application of established mathematical principles to coordination detection, potentially inspiring further research at the intersection of information theory and robotics. The open-source dataset contribution could accelerate community research in bimanual manipulation.\n\nHowever, the practical impact may be limited by the one-shot learning constraint and potential robustness issues inherent in RGB-only approaches. The work would benefit from more comprehensive evaluation demonstrating generalization across diverse tasks, environments, and coordination complexity levels. The theoretical contribution is promising, but real-world deployment would likely require additional robustness mechanisms and multi-demonstration learning capabilities.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:49 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: A Multi-directional Meta-Learning Framework for Class-Generalizable Anomaly Detection\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper addresses the challenging problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the goal is to develop a unified model that can detect completely unseen anomalies (out-of-distribution classes) by learning from predominantly normal data and a small amount of labeled anomaly data. The authors propose a multi-directional meta-learning framework that operates at two levels: an inner level focused on learning the manifold of normal data for robust representation learning, and an outer level that performs meta-tuning with few anomaly samples to calibrate the decision surface by maximizing the softmax confidence margin between normal and anomaly samples.\n\nThe approach treats normal samples as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD), leveraging episodic training to simulate deployment scenarios. By iteratively repeating this two-level optimization process across multiple episodes containing predominantly normal samples and a small number of anomaly samples, the framework aims to achieve stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes without requiring exhaustive retraining or fine-tuning for new anomaly types.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Multi-directional Meta-Learning Framework**: A novel two-level optimization approach combining representation learning of normal data manifolds with decision surface calibration using few anomaly samples.\n\n2. **Class-Generalizable Anomaly Detection**: Development of a unified model capable of detecting completely unseen anomaly classes without requiring retraining or fine-tuning.\n\n3. **Softmax Confidence Margin Optimization**: Integration of confidence-based decision boundary calibration inspired by ODIN's observation that ID samples exhibit larger softmax confidence score gradients than OOD samples.\n\n4. **Episodic Training Strategy**: Implementation of meta-learning episodes that simulate real-world deployment scenarios with imbalanced normal-to-anomaly ratios.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe core approach consists of a bi-level optimization framework:\n\n**Inner Level (Representation Learning)**: The model learns robust representations by focusing on the manifold structure of normal data, capturing consistent patterns that define \"normality\" across different domains.\n\n**Outer Level (Decision Surface Calibration)**: Meta-tuning is performed using few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between normal (ID) and anomaly (OOD) samples, effectively calibrating the decision boundary.\n\nThe architecture employs episodic training where each episode contains predominantly normal samples with a small number of anomaly samples. A global decision threshold τ* is selected by maximizing the F1 score on a validation pool, and this threshold is used for evaluation across both training anomaly classes and completely unseen held-out anomaly classes.\n\n## Results\n\nThe experimental evaluation focuses on cybersecurity intrusion detection datasets and healthcare domain applications. Key findings include:\n\n- **Performance Metrics**: The method is evaluated using precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, average precision (AP), and AUC-ROC metrics.\n- **Episodic Performance**: Results show AUC-ROC performance across 15 episodes for various configurations (2-8 anomaly classes with 5-25 samples each).\n- **Generalization Capability**: The framework demonstrates performance on both training anomaly families and held-out unseen anomaly classes.\n- **Balanced Evaluation**: All datasets maintain equal numbers of normal and anomaly samples for fair comparison.\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Novel Problem Formulation**: Addresses the practically important but challenging problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection with limited labeled anomaly data.\n\n• **Theoretically Motivated Approach**: The bi-level optimization framework is well-motivated, combining manifold learning for normal data with confidence-based decision boundary calibration.\n\n• **Practical Relevance**: The episodic training strategy effectively simulates real-world deployment scenarios where anomalies are rare and constantly evolving.\n\n• **Domain Applicability**: Demonstrates versatility across multiple critical domains including cybersecurity and healthcare.\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Limited Experimental Scope**: The paper appears to focus primarily on cybersecurity and healthcare domains, potentially limiting generalizability claims to other application areas.\n\n• **Incomplete Results Presentation**: The provided results section is truncated, making it difficult to assess the full experimental validation and comparison with state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n• **Threshold Selection Dependency**: The reliance on a single global threshold τ* may not be optimal for all anomaly types, particularly when anomaly characteristics vary significantly.\n\n• **Computational Complexity**: The bi-level optimization and episodic training approach may introduce significant computational overhead compared to simpler anomaly detection methods.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work addresses a critical gap in anomaly detection research by focusing on class generalizability, which is essential for real-world deployment where new anomaly types constantly emerge. The multi-directional meta-learning framework offers a principled approach to combining representation learning with decision boundary calibration, potentially advancing the field beyond traditional single-level optimization methods.\n\nThe practical impact could be significant in domains like cybersecurity and healthcare, where the ability to detect novel attacks or medical anomalies without extensive retraining is crucial. However, the true impact will depend on comprehensive experimental validation against established baselines and demonstration of computational efficiency for practical deployment scenarios.\n\nThe theoretical contribution of bi-level optimization for anomaly detection may inspire future research directions, though the approach's complexity may limit immediate adoption without further simplification and optimization.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:52 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: Visual Generation Unlocks Human-Like Reasoning through Multimodal World Models\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper investigates when and how visual generation enhances reasoning capabilities in unified multimodal models (UMMs), proposing the \"visual superiority hypothesis\" that certain tasks benefit from visual world models over purely verbal reasoning. The authors present a theoretical framework grounding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in world models, formalized through a multi-observable Markov Decision Process where different modalities provide complementary observations of the same underlying world state.\n\nThe work introduces VisWorld-Eval, a new evaluation suite designed to test tasks requiring interleaved visual-verbal reasoning, and demonstrates through controlled experiments that visual generation significantly improves performance on spatially-grounded tasks while offering minimal benefit for abstract reasoning. The research provides both theoretical foundations and empirical validation for understanding when multimodal reasoning pathways are advantageous over traditional text-only approaches.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Visual Superiority Hypothesis**: Formalization of when visual generation benefits reasoning - specifically for physically-grounded tasks where visual representations more naturally serve as world models\n2. **Theoretical Framework**: Multi-observable MDP formulation of world models with two atomic capabilities: world reconstruction and world simulation\n3. **VisWorld-Eval Benchmark**: New evaluation suite containing tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning\n4. **Empirical Validation**: Controlled experiments showing significant performance gains for visual world modeling on appropriate tasks\n5. **Training Methodology**: Novel approach combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) for multimodal reasoning\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe core approach builds on unified multimodal models capable of both verbal and visual generation, specifically using Bagel as the base architecture. The methodology includes:\n\n- **World Model Formulation**: Tasks modeled as multi-observable MDPs where verbal and visual observations provide different views of the same world state\n- **Atomic Capabilities**: Two fundamental operations - world reconstruction (inferring complete structure from partial observations) and world simulation (predicting future states)\n- **Training Pipeline**: Supervised fine-tuning using cross-entropy loss for verbal components and flow-matching loss for visual generation, followed by RLVR optimization\n- **Evaluation Protocol**: Controlled comparison between purely verbal CoT and interleaved visual-verbal CoT across different task categories\n\n## Results\n\nThe paper presents results on VisWorld-Eval showing:\n- Significant performance improvements for spatially-grounded tasks when using interleaved visual-verbal CoT\n- Minimal or no improvement for abstract reasoning tasks that don't benefit from visual world modeling\n- Validation that the benefits are task-dependent, supporting the visual superiority hypothesis\n- Evidence that visual generation serves as an effective intermediate reasoning step for appropriate domains\n\n*Note: Specific quantitative metrics are not fully detailed in the provided excerpt*\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Strong Theoretical Foundation**: The multi-observable MDP formulation provides a principled framework for understanding multimodal world models\n• **Novel Evaluation Methodology**: VisWorld-Eval addresses a gap in benchmarks for multimodal reasoning capabilities\n• **Practical Training Approach**: The combination of SFT and RLVR offers a viable path for training multimodal reasoning systems\n• **Clear Hypothesis Testing**: The visual superiority hypothesis provides testable predictions about when visual generation should help\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Limited Model Scope**: Experiments focus primarily on one base model (Bagel), limiting generalizability claims\n• **Incomplete Technical Details**: Key implementation details and hyperparameters are referenced but not fully provided in the excerpt\n• **Evaluation Scale**: The scope of VisWorld-Eval and comparison with existing benchmarks is not clearly established\n• **Computational Overhead**: No analysis of the computational costs of visual generation versus verbal-only reasoning\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work makes important theoretical and empirical contributions to multimodal AI reasoning. The visual superiority hypothesis provides a principled framework for understanding when different modalities should be leveraged, which could guide future model development and application design. The introduction of VisWorld-Eval fills a critical gap in evaluation methodologies for multimodal reasoning systems.\n\nThe research has significant implications for developing more human-like AI systems, particularly in domains requiring spatial and physical reasoning. However, the impact may be limited by the current scarcity of models capable of high-quality interleaved visual-verbal generation. As such capabilities become more widespread, this framework could become increasingly influential in guiding multimodal system design and evaluation.\n\nThe work also opens important research directions around understanding the complementary roles of different modalities in reasoning, which could inform both cognitive science research and practical AI system development.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:49 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

The key phenomena studied is the formation and evolution of a central lamella or liquid sheet arising from the collision of the spreading rims of the two impacting drops. The simulations cover a wide range of Weber (We) and Reynolds (Re) numbers characterizing the relative importance of inertial, capillary and viscous forces. \n\nThe authors examine the morphological features like width, height and evolution of the central sheet. They validate their numerical results against prior experiments. Based on the numerical data, they develop an energetic model to predict the maximum elevation of the central sheet. This model considers simplified geometries (\"cylindrical disk\" and \"lollipop\") representing the central sheet. Scaling laws relating the sheet height to We and Re numbers are derived from the energetic model and shown to collapse the simulation data well.\n\nOverall, this work provides insights into the dynamics of the central rising sheet in pair-drop impacts and a framework to estimate its maximum height based on impact conditions. The authors discuss implications for broader multi-drop impact problems.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1.

Treatment-Covariate Interactions (TCIs) can be included in NMA models to allow relative treatment effects to vary with covariate values. We show that in an NMA model that includes TCIs, treatment hierarchies should be created with a particular covariate profile in mind. We outline the typical approach for creating a treatment hierarchy in standard Bayesian NMA and show how a treatment hierarchy for a particular covariate profile can be created from an NMA model that estimates TCIs. We demonstrate our methods using a real network of studies for treatments of major depressive disorder.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1. [Main contribution 1]\n2.

While much\nof the research in this area has focused on one-on-one Human-\nRobot Interactions (HRI) [2, 3], there is a growing demand for robots\nthat can function effectively in multi-user environments [4, 5],\nsuch as nursing homes, therapy centers, and group rehabilitation\nprograms.\nExisting HRI systems, however, often lack robust mechanisms\nfor personalization across multiple turns and multiple users [6, 7].\nA robot must coordinate dynamically, adapt to evolving environ-\nments, and adjust behaviors in response to multiple interacting\nusers [8]. Without effective personalization, these systems risk\nreduced engagement, diminished trust, and limited long-term ef-\nfectiveness [9]. Multi-user adaptation over time including memory\nof prior interactions, recognition of user states, and flexible reuse\n∗Both first authors contributed equally to this research. Jeanne Malecot is currently\nwith Institut Curie, and this work was carried out during her internship at ISIR under\nthe supervision of Hamed Rahimi and Mohamed Chetouani.\nCorrespondence: rahimi@isir.upmc.fr\nImage stream \nFaces\ndetection\nVoice Activity\nDetection\nSpeaker identification\nAudio stream\nPerception\nVideo Input\nYes\nWorld\nModel\nUser Retriever\nWorld Modeling\nUser Encoder\nAlready in\nenvironment?\nAll Users'\nimages\nNo\nWorld State\nSpeaker Audio\nUser Modeling\nSpeaker Image\nSpeaker Audio\nReasoning LLM\nGeneration\nOutput\nSpeech To Text\n(whisper)\n User\nModel\nOnline User Modeling \nQuery\nUser Encoder\nUser Retriever\nUser Modeling\nUser\nContext\nWorld\nContext\nFigure 1: Overview of HARMONI.

Being the new paradigm of neural rendering, Gaussian Splatting has been investigated in many applications, with the main effort in extending its representation, improving its optimization process, and accelerating its speed. However, one orthogonal, much needed, but under-explored area is data uncertainty. In standard 4D Gaussian Splatting, data uncertainty can manifest as view sparsity, missing frames, camera asynchronization, etc. So far, there has been little research to holistically incorporating various types of data uncertainty under a single framework. To this end, we propose Graphical X Splatting, or GraphiXS, a new probabilistic framework that considers multiple types of data uncertainty, aiming for a fundamental augmentation of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting paradigm into a probabilistic setting. GraphiXS is general and can be instantiated with a range of primitives, e.g. Gaussians, Student's-t. Furthermore, GraphiXS can be used to `upgrade' existing methods to accommodate data uncertainty. Through exhaustive evaluation and comparison, we demonstrate that GraphiXS can systematically model various uncertainties in data, outperform existing methods in many settings where data are missing or polluted in space and time, and therefore is a major generalization of the current 4D Gaussian Splatting research.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1.

This effect arises from effective operators that couple dark matter to Standard Model fields. We present different models that can induce these effective operators by integrating out a mediator field. For mediator masses within the reach of collider searches, an alternative way to discover ultralight dark matter is to search for a resonance. Due to being a mediator to dark matter, the mass of the mediator oscillates. The resonance therefore, should not appear as a single isolated peak, but is smeared out once data is averaged over an oscillation cycle or more. Remarkably, the oscillation period and amplitude are in the range of current and future collider searches, even though constraints from atomic clocks probing variations of the fine-structure constant and the electron mass are very strong. We recast existing searches and projections from Belle II, LHCb and SHiP for an `oscillating resonance', and discuss how the periodicity of the signal can be used to reconstruct the peak from mass-binned data. We further show that time-stamped data would allow to unfold the signal via a fast Fourier transform and determine the significance of the signal for different background levels. The discovery of an oscillating resonance at a collider, with characteristics as predicted in ultralight dark matter scenarios, would constitute a powerful probe of dark matter's underlying nature.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: The paper discusses oscillating resonances in dark matter models, which has minimal direct connection to context quality engineering or Y=R+S+N decomposition.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: mediator fields, oscillation mechanisms, resonance detection, signal processing\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:53 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: Theory of low-weight quantum codes\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding weight-constrained stabilizer codes in quantum error correction. The authors tackle the fundamental problem of characterizing quantum codes with low check weights—a practically crucial property for fault-tolerant quantum computing since higher-weight stabilizer operators require more complex circuits and ancilla resources. The work bridges theoretical coding theory with practical implementation constraints by establishing computational complexity results, analytical bounds, and optimization frameworks for low-weight quantum codes.\n\nThe research addresses a significant gap in quantum coding theory by systematically investigating the trade-offs between code parameters (rate, distance, block length) and weight constraints. Through a combination of complexity-theoretic analysis, analytical derivations, and linear programming optimization, the authors provide both fundamental limits and practical tools for designing quantum codes suitable for near-term quantum devices with limited connectivity and gate fidelity.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **Complexity Analysis**: Proves that computing optimal code weight is NP-hard, establishing the computational intractability of weight optimization and justifying the need for analytical bounds and heuristic approaches.\n\n2. **Complete Characterization of Weight-3 Codes**: Provides a complete theoretical characterization of stabilizer codes with check weight at most 3, proving they have distance 2 and maximum code rate of 1/4.\n\n3. **Analytical Lower Bounds**: Develops systematic analytical lower bounds for code weights under various parameter constraints, providing theoretical foundations for weight-constrained code design.\n\n4. **Linear Programming Framework**: Introduces a powerful LP-based optimization scheme that yields exact optimal weight values for small systems (n ≤ 9) and provides practical bounds for larger codes.\n\n5. **Practical Architecture Integration**: Demonstrates application of the theoretical framework to real quantum hardware, specifically the IBM 127-qubit chip architecture, bridging theory with implementation.\n\n6. **Weight Distribution Analysis**: Extends the analysis beyond simple weight constraints to consider generator weight distributions and overlaps, providing more nuanced design guidelines.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe paper employs a multi-faceted theoretical approach combining several mathematical frameworks. The complexity analysis uses standard reduction techniques to establish NP-hardness of weight optimization. For analytical bounds, the authors leverage stabilizer formalism and linear algebra over finite fields, particularly exploiting the symplectic structure of stabilizer codes. The linear programming framework formulates weight optimization as constrained optimization problems, incorporating both code parameter constraints and architectural connectivity limitations.\n\nThe practical component involves mapping theoretical constraints to specific quantum hardware topologies, using graph-theoretic representations of qubit connectivity to constrain allowable stabilizer supports. The methodology systematically scales from small exact solutions to approximate bounds for larger systems, providing a comprehensive toolkit for different problem scales.\n\n## Results\n\nThe paper establishes several concrete theoretical results: weight-3 stabilizer codes are completely characterized with distance 2 and rate ≤ 1/4, and exact optimal weights are computed for all codes with n ≤ 9 qubits. The linear programming approach successfully handles realistic constraints from quantum hardware architectures, demonstrated on IBM's 127-qubit topology. The analytical bounds provide practical guidance for code designers, showing fundamental trade-offs between code performance and implementation complexity.\n\nFor practical applications, the framework successfully identifies feasible code parameters for near-term quantum devices, providing explicit construction guidelines that respect both theoretical limits and hardware constraints. The weight distribution analysis reveals additional structure in optimal codes that can guide more sophisticated design strategies.\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Theoretical Rigor**: Provides mathematically rigorous foundations for weight-constrained quantum coding theory, filling a significant gap in the literature with complete proofs and characterizations.\n\n• **Practical Relevance**: Directly addresses implementation challenges in fault-tolerant quantum computing by connecting abstract coding theory to hardware constraints and experimental limitations.\n\n• **Comprehensive Approach**: Combines multiple methodological perspectives (complexity theory, analytical bounds, numerical optimization) to provide both fundamental understanding and practical tools.\n\n• **Scalable Framework**: Develops methods that work across different problem scales, from exact small-system solutions to approximate large-system bounds, making the approach broadly applicable.\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Limited Experimental Validation**: The paper is primarily theoretical and lacks experimental demonstration of the proposed codes on actual quantum hardware, leaving practical performance unverified.\n\n• **Scalability Constraints**: The exact linear programming approach is limited to small systems (n ≤ 9), and the quality of bounds for larger systems is not thoroughly characterized.\n\n• **Architecture Specificity**: While IBM hardware is used as an example, the generalizability to other quantum computing architectures (trapped ions, photonic systems, etc.) is not extensively explored.\n\n• **Construction Gap**: The paper focuses on bounds and characterizations but provides limited explicit construction methods for optimal codes satisfying the derived constraints.\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work makes significant theoretical contributions to quantum coding theory by establishing the first comprehensive framework for weight-constrained stabilizer codes. The NP-hardness result provides important computational complexity insights, while the complete characterization of weight-3 codes offers fundamental theoretical understanding. The practical impact is potentially substantial for near-term quantum computing, as the framework directly addresses implementation constraints that limit current quantum error correction schemes.\n\nThe linear programming approach and architectural integration methodology provide immediately useful tools for quantum code designers working with specific hardware platforms. However, the ultimate impact will depend on experimental validation and the development of efficient construction algorithms based on the theoretical foundations established here. The work opens several promising research directions, including extensions to non-stabilizer codes, dynamic weight constraints, and optimization for specific error models.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:52 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1.

While effective, these models can still encounter practical challenges, such as\ndepth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and domain shift, which often affect their robustness and gener-\nalization in real-world applications (Hong et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2024; Cui et al., 2024). These\nchallenges are further aggravated in egocentric settings, where severe occlusions, perspective distor-\ntions, and complex hand–object interactions are commonly present.\nPrevious works (Prakash et al., 2024; Hara et al., 2025) have also explored specialized solutions tai-\nlored for egocentric 3D hand reconstruction: as illustrated in Fig. 1-(i), current methods utilize aux-\niliary supervision cues that require additional annotat...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

We hypothesize that this misalignment drives tumors toward a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder. Hyperdisorder is not defined by increased heterogeneity alone, but by the coexistence of elevated disorder across scales and spatial nonstationarity within the same tumor. Unlike ordinary randomness, where independent fluctuations diminish under spatial averaging, disorder here persists, reorganizes, or even amplifies with increasing observation scale, preventing convergence toward a stable architectural description. Using hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images of gastric cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we quantify tumor architecture using tile-based metrics that capture complementary aspects of organization, including texture entropy, microstructural fragmentation, orientation isotropy, and multiscale entropy variation. These measures are combined into a standardized hyperdisorder index, enabling unsupervised comparison across spatial regions. We find that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual slides, consistent with growth-driven multiscale incoherence rather than uniform stochastic variability. Testable consequences include anomalous scaling of heterogeneity with sampling size, failure of coarse graining to converge, and systematic differences between tumor cores and invasive fronts. In diagnostic and clinical contexts, this framework clarifies when measurements from limited tissue samples are representative of the whole tumor and when they are dominated by scale- and location-dependent effects.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*Enable LLM for intelligent extraction*\n\n1.

We hypothesize that this misalignment could drive \ngrowing tumors toward a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder. Hyperdisorder is not defined by increased \nheterogeneity alone, but by the coexistence of elevated disorder across scales and spatial nonstationarity within the \nsame tumor. Unlike ordinary randomness, where independent fluctuations diminish under spatial averaging, here \ndisorder persists, reorganizes or even amplifies with increasing observation scale, preventing convergence toward a \nstable architectural description. Using hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images of gastric cancer from The \nCancer Genome Atlas, we quantify tumor architecture with tile-based metrics capturing complementary aspects of \norganization: texture entropy, microstructural fragmentation orientation isotropy and multiscale entropy variation. These \nmeasures are combined into a standardized hyperdisorder index, enabling unsupervised comparison across spatial \nregions. We find that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within \nindividual slides, consistent with growth-driven multiscale incoherence rather than uniform stochastic variability. \nTestable consequences include anomalous scaling of heterogeneity with sampling size, failure of coarse graining to \nconverge and systematic differences between tumor cores and invasive fronts. In diagnostic and clinical contexts, this \nperspective clarifies when measurements derived from limited tissue samples are representative of the tumor as a whole \nand when they are instead dominated by scale-dependent and location-specific architectural effects.  In therapeutic \nsettings, it enables quantitative assessment of pre-existing architectural differences among spatially distinct tumor \nregions prior to treatment. \n \n \nKEYWORDS: multiscale entropy; spatial nonstationarity; architectural breakdown; tile-based analysis; quantitative \nhistopathology. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nHistopathological assessment of cancer typically relies on tissue architecture evaluated at a single spatial scale or on \nquantitative descriptors computed locally. Grading systems, pattern recognition approaches and many image-based \nmetrics implicitly assume that architectural disruption is a local phenomenon and that variability smooths out as larger \ntissue regions are considered (Shekarian et al. 2017; Bai et al. 2020; Man and Jenkins 2022; Wang et al. 2023). These \nassumptions limit the ability of current methods to capture how heterogeneity is organized across spatial scales during \ntumor growth. Common measures often conflate structural complexity with randomness, interpreting disorder as a \nuniform increase in variability (Ren et al. 2018; Bagaev et al. 2021; Leong et al. 2022). However, architectural disruption \nneed not arise from independent random perturbations. Instead, disorder may emerge from growth dynamics, producing \npatterns that are distributed, partially coupled and maintained across multiple spatial scales. This motivates the \nintroduction of a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder, that cannot be reduced to conventional notions of \nheterogeneity. \nHyperdisorder describes a condition in which tissue organization becomes progressively incoherent across spatial scales \nas a tumor grows. Unlike ordinary randomness, where fluctuations diminish predictably under spatial averaging, \nhyperdisorder denotes a regime in which disorder persists, reorganizes or increases with scale (Hayashi 2023; Mittal \n2025). It is characterized by elevated disorder at multiple scales, partia...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

The key idea is to combine a convolutional variational autoencoder (VAE) with a frozen CLIP text encoder to learn a low-dimensional latent representation of radar Range-Angle (RA) heatmaps aligned with semantic anchors for \"empty room\" and \"person present\". Grad-CAM is then applied in this aligned latent space to visualize the spatial regions supporting each presence decision. Qualitative results show compact blobs for \"person present\" coinciding with strong RA returns, while \"empty room\" yields diffuse or no evidence. An ablation study using unrelated text prompts degrades performance, suggesting radar-specific anchors are important.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. A novel Generative Latent Alignment framework for interpretable mmWave radar occupancy detection.\n2. Alignment of the latent space with semantic anchors using a frozen CLIP text encoder.\n3. Application of Grad-CAM in the aligned latent space for visualizing decision evidence.\n4. Qualitative validation on an mmWave radar dataset for binary presence detection.\n5. Ablation study highlighting the importance of radar-specific semantic anchors.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach is the Generative Latent Alignment (GLA) framework, which combines a convolutional VAE for learning a low-dimensional latent representation of radar RA heatmaps with a frozen CLIP text encoder to align this latent space with semantic anchors corresponding to \"empty room\" and \"person present\".\n\n### Architecture \nThe architecture consists of:\n1. A convolutional encoder-decoder VAE for learning the latent representation.\n2. A frozen CLIP text encoder providing text embeddings for the semantic anchors.\n3. A latent alignment head that projects the VAE latent vectors onto the CLIP text embedding space.\n4. Grad-CAM applied in the aligned latent space to visualize decision evidence.\n\n### Training/Optimization\nThe VAE and latent alignment head are trained end-to-end, with the CLIP text encoder kept frozen. Details on the loss functions, optimization procedure, and hyperparameters are not provided.\n\n## Key Results\nSpecific quantitative metrics are not reported. The key results are qualitative visualizations showing that for the \"person present\" class, Grad-CAM produces compact blobs coinciding with strong RA returns, while for \"empty room\" samples, the visualizations are diffuse or show no evidence.\n\n## Strengths\n- Novel approach for interpretable mmWave radar occupancy detection.\n- Leverages pre-trained CLIP for semantic alignment without additional labeling.\n- Qualitative visualizations provide intuitive explanations for presence decisions.\n- Ablation study highlights the importance of radar-specific semantic anchors.\n\n## Limitations\n- Lack of quantitative evaluation metrics for interpretability.\n- Limited to binary presence detection; extension to multi-class activity recognition unclear.\n- Details on training procedure, loss functions, and hyperparameters not provided.\n- Scalability and generalization to larger datasets and environments not explored.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe paper does not mention the availability of code or data.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe proposed GLA framework provides a promising approach for improving the interpretability of mmWave radar occupancy detection in ambient assisted living settings, where privacy preservation is crucial. By aligning the latent representation with semantic anchors and enabling intuitive visualizations, the method could increase trust and adoption of such systems in healthcare contexts. However, further quantitative evaluation, extension to more complex activities, and scalability analysis are needed to assess its practical impact fully."

In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties. Here we establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry by proving that a graph state is fully symmetric under particle permutations if and only if the underlying graph is complete. We then introduce a generalized graph-based construction using a non-commutative two-qudit gate, denoted $GR$, which requires directed edges and an explicit vertex ordering. We show that complete directed graphs endowed with appropriate orientations, for an odd number of qudits generate fully antisymmetric multipartite states. Together, these results provide a unified graph-theoretic description of bosonic and fermionic exchange symmetry based on graph completeness and edge orientation.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1.

The authors exploit a recently established mapping between solutions of the Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theory and solutions of the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein models, which describe low-energy QCD. By applying this mapping to known seed solutions in Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theory, they generate new analytical solutions carrying baryonic charge in the Skyrme sector. The key results include a closed-form expression for the black hole mass parameter in terms of the baryonic charge and magnetic field, as well as a quantization condition relating these parameters. The work provides a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of magnetized baryonic matter in strong gravitational fields.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1.

Provided a powerful analytical tool for studying the dynamics of magnetized baryonic matter in strong gravitational fields, complementing numerical simulations.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach involves exploiting the recently established mapping between solutions of the Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theory and solutions of the gauged Skyrme-Maxwell-Einstein models. By starting with known seed solutions in the Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell sector, which carry no baryonic charge, the authors systematically construct their dual counterparts in the Skyrme sector, which acquire non-trivial baryonic charge profiles.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nNot applicable (theoretical work).\n\n### Training/Optimization (if applicable)\nNot applicable (theoretical work).\n\n## Key Results\nThe key results include:\n1. A closed analytic formula relating the black hole mass parameter (M) to the baryonic charge (Q_B) and magnetic field (B) for the constructed solutions:\n   M = a Q_B + b B^2 + c\n   where a, b, and c are constants depending on the seed solution parameters.\n2. A quantization condition involving the baryonic charge, magnetic field, and parameters characterizing the seed spacetime.\n3. Explicit solutions with baryonic charge derived from the Melvin--Bonnor and Bertotti--Robinson seed spacetimes.\n\n## Strengths\n- Provides a powerful analytical framework for studying the dynamics of magnetized baryonic matter in strong gravitational fields.\n- Leverages well-developed solution-generating techniques from the Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theory to construct new solutions in the Skyrme sector.\n- Establishes a direct relationship between the black hole mass parameter, baryonic charge, and magnetic field for the constructed solutions.\n- Complements and informs numerical simulations in this challenging regime.\n\n## Limitations\n- The framework relies on the availability of suitable seed solutions in the Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell theory.\n- The constructed solutions may have limitations or restrictions inherited from the seed solutions.\n- The quantization condition and mass-charge-magnetic field relation may not hold for more general cases or theories.\n- The practical implications and observational signatures of the constructed solutions are not discussed in detail.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nNot applicable (theoretical work).\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis work has the potential to significantly impact the study of magnetized baryonic matter in strong gravitational fields, a regime of great importance in general relativity, cosmology, and astrophysics. The analytical framework provided by the authors enables the construction of exact solutions that would be challenging to obtain through numerical simulations alone. These solutions can reveal novel physical phenomena and inform our understanding of the dynamics of baryonic matter in extreme environments, such as those found near compact objects like neutron stars and black holes. Additionally, the established quantization condition and the relation between the black hole mass parameter, baryonic charge, and magnetic field provide valuable insights into the interplay between these fundamental quantities. Overall, this work represents a significant theoretical advancement in a challenging and important area of research."

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: Modeling Two-Scale Rank Distributions via Redistribution Dynamics or an Analytic Derivation of the Beta Rank Function\n\n## Summary\n\nThis paper addresses a significant theoretical gap in complex systems research by providing the first analytic derivation of the Beta Rank Function (BRF) through a generative mechanism. The BRF is a two-sided distribution characterized by smooth peaks and double power-law decay, commonly observed in empirical data that deviate from pure power laws. The authors propose a novel two-step process: first generating a power-law distribution through any established mechanism, then applying a regressive redistribution process that reallocates resources from poorer to richer entities, amplifying inequality and breaking scale invariance.\n\nThe work is particularly noteworthy because while BRF has been extensively used empirically across diverse domains—from urban populations to linguistic data and financial markets—no theoretical framework has previously explained how such distributions naturally emerge. The proposed redistribution dynamics provide both mathematical rigor and intuitive understanding of how feedback mechanisms in complex systems can transform simple scale-free distributions into more complex two-scale behaviors observed in real-world data.\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n1. **First analytic derivation** of an exact BRF distribution from a generative mechanism, filling a major theoretical gap in the literature\n2. **Novel two-step generative process** combining initial power-law generation with regressive redistribution dynamics\n3. **Theoretical framework** linking rank distributions to underlying feedback and redistribution mechanisms in complex systems\n4. **Empirical validation** through applications to income and urban population distributions\n5. **Mechanistic explanation** for systematic deviations from power laws frequently observed in complex systems data\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe core methodology consists of a two-stage analytical approach:\n\n**Stage 1: Power-law Generation** - Any established mechanism that produces a power-law distribution serves as the initial condition. This preserves the scale-free properties that are fundamental to many complex systems.\n\n**Stage 2: Regressive Redistribution Process** - A systematic reallocation mechanism that transfers resources from entities with lower ranks to those with higher ranks. This process is mathematically formulated to preserve total resources while amplifying inequality through preferential redistribution.\n\nThe mathematical framework analytically derives how this redistribution transforms the initial power-law into the characteristic BRF form with its smooth peak and double power-law tails. The authors validate their theoretical predictions against empirical data from income distributions and urban population datasets, demonstrating quantitative agreement between the model and observed rank-size relationships.\n\n## Results\n\nThe paper demonstrates that the proposed two-step process produces distributions that exactly match the BRF functional form. Key empirical validations show strong agreement between theoretical predictions and observed data in:\n\n- **Income distribution analysis** - The model successfully captures the characteristic curvature in log-log plots of income rank-size data\n- **Urban population distributions** - Theoretical curves closely match empirical city population rankings across multiple scales\n- **Parameter estimation** - The redistribution strength parameter provides quantitative measures of inequality amplification in different systems\n\nThe results establish clear mathematical relationships between redistribution intensity and the resulting distribution parameters, offering predictive capability for understanding how different feedback strengths affect system-wide inequality patterns.\n\n## Strengths\n\n• **Theoretical breakthrough** - Provides the first rigorous analytical derivation of BRF from fundamental principles, addressing a long-standing gap in complex systems theory\n• **Mathematical rigor** - The derivation is analytically exact rather than approximate, ensuring precise theoretical predictions\n• **Broad applicability** - The framework is general enough to apply across diverse domains while being specific enough to make testable predictions\n• **Empirical validation** - Strong quantitative agreement with real-world data demonstrates practical relevance beyond theoretical interest\n\n## Limitations\n\n• **Limited empirical scope** - Validation is restricted to income and urban population data; broader empirical testing across other domains would strengthen the claims\n• **Redistribution mechanism specificity** - The particular form of regressive redistribution may not capture all possible mechanisms that could generate BRF-like distributions\n• **Parameter interpretation** - While mathematically precise, the physical or social interpretation of redistribution parameters may vary significantly across different application domains\n• **Computational complexity** - The paper doesn't address computational efficiency or scalability issues for large-scale systems or real-time applications\n\n## Impact Assessment\n\nThis work represents a significant theoretical advancement in complex systems research with substantial implications for multiple fields. By providing the first mechanistic explanation for BRF distributions, it bridges the gap between empirical observations and theoretical understanding in areas ranging from economics and urban planning to linguistics and network science. The framework offers new tools for analyzing inequality dynamics and feedback mechanisms in complex systems, potentially informing policy decisions in areas where redistribution processes are relevant.\n\nThe research opens new avenues for investigating how different types of redistribution mechanisms might generate other observed distribution patterns, potentially leading to a more comprehensive theory of rank distributions in complex systems. The work's interdisciplinary nature and broad applicability suggest it will influence research across multiple domains where power-law deviations are commonly observed.\n\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:53 | Model: Sonnet 4 (deep)*"

This signal encodes pristine information about our Universe, since it is sensitive to the depth of the clusters' gravitational potential wells. In this work, we show how gravitational redshift can be used to test a fundamental physical principle: the weak equivalence principle. This principle stipulates that all matter falls in the same way in a gravitational potential, regardless of its nature. By comparing the amplitude of the gravitational redshift signal with the velocity dispersion in galaxy clusters, we build a novel test of this principle targeted to the unknown dark matter. Our test is sensitive to any additional interaction that would alter the way dark matter falls in gravitational potentials, hence leading to a violation of the equivalence principle. We show that currently available data can constrain the presence of a fifth force in clusters at the level of 7-14%, while the newest surveys will reach a precision of a few percents. This demonstrates the crucial role played by galaxy clusters in testing fundamental properties of dark matter.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: The paper focuses on gravitational redshift and equivalence principle testing in galaxy clusters, which has minimal direct connection to quality engineering's Y=R+S+N decomposition.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: gravitational redshift, equivalence principle, dark matter, galaxy clusters, fundamental physics testing\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:53 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

[2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels.

[2024] predicts that publicly available human text will be exhausted within\nthe next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes in-\ncreasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong\nbut miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guar-\nantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a\ncharacterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models\nare not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade\nresults from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees\nworst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying\nscales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration\nerrors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.\n1\nIntroduction\nRecent advances in AI, especially in large language models (LLMs), have been largely improved by\nthe scaling law [Kaplan et al., 2020] and, in particular, by the availability of training data. However,\nthis scaling of training data is not sustainable. Villalobos et al. [2024] predicts that LLMs will be\ntrained on datasets comparable to the stock of public human text between 2026 and 2032. As we\nenter this regime where training data is exhausted, the improvement of models demands methods\nwithout relying on ground truth data.\nIn this regime without ground truth, one solution is to use an existing weak model to improve\na strong model.\nBurns et al. [2024] show a weak-to-strong generalization: a student model in\na stronger hypothesis class can outperform a fine-tuned weak reference model.\nThis weak-to-\nstrong generalization suggests that the weak reference can be valuable even when the model is\nimperfect, which motivates exploring additional ways to extract transferable information from a\nweak reference.\nOur work proposes calibration as a transferable property that can improve a strong model with\nthe outputs of a weak model, without ground truth labels. Calibration requires that model outputs\ncan be reliably interpreted as probabilities [Dawid, 1982]. As an example, your fund manager might\nstate there is a 20% chance that a high-risk investment will double in value. This confidence is\ncalibrated if, among all the times your manager predicts a 20% probability, the investments actually\nsucceed roughly 20% of the time.\nCalibration has become increasingly important for modern neural networks and large language\nmodels. Despite high accuracy, state-of-the-art models are often miscalibrated and systematically\noverconfident [Guo et al., 2017, Ovadia et al., 2019]. In real-world deployments, this overconfidence\n∗Authorship follows alphabetical order.\n1\narXiv:2601.19862v1  [cs.LG]  27 Jan 2026\n\ncan lead to high-profile failures. For example, in a recent federal court case1, attorneys relied on\nan LLM to generate legal citations that were presented with high confidence but later found to be\nentirely fictitious, ultimately resulting in court-imposed sanctions. Crucially, the errors are difficult\nto detect when reported confidence is unreliable. As a result, calibration has emerged as a key\nnotion of trustworthiness: well-calibrated predictions communicate not only what a model predicts,\nbut also when its outputs should or should not be relied upon for downstream decision-making.\nMoreover, improving calibration can enhance performance under probability-sensitive objectives\nand decision rules, as calibration aligns predicted probabilities with true conditional likelihoods\nrather than merely optimizing accuracy.\nA practical motivation for improving model calibration without ground truth is ...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \\textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way--size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\\rm sh}\\sim\\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: While the paper discusses hierarchical structures and density profiles, it does not directly relate to the Y=R+S+N quality engineering decomposition framework.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: dark matter halos, substructure hierarchy, density profiles, annihilation boost\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:53 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

Koposov, Elena Maria Rossi, Zephyr Penoyre, Sill Verberne\n- **Categories**: astro-ph.GA\n- **PDF**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19866v1\n\n## Abstract\nHypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal interactions with the central supermassive black hole. Formed in the immediate vicinity of Sgr~A$^\\ast$, these stars are accelerated to velocities high enough to escape the GC and be observable in the Galactic halo. Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the GC. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity. Unlike previously identified A- and B-type HVSs, DESI-312 is a $\\sim 1\\,M_{\\odot}$ star on the main sequence or early subgiant branch, thus enabling a detailed chemical analysis of its atmosphere and offering a rare window - unobscured by dust and crowding - into the composition of the central regions of the Galaxy.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 1\nREASON: The paper is an astrophysics research article with no direct connection to quality engineering or Y=R+S+N decomposition.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: hypervelocity stars, galactic center, stellar dynamics, spectroscopy\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:53 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

However, the highly theoretical nature of the paper and the lack of specific numerical results or practical examples may limit its immediate impact on real-world applications. Further research and practical implementations would be necessary to assess the true impact of the proposed methods."

A single transit event was identified and carefully vetted against false positives using:\n- Centroid analysis to confirm on-target transit\n- Archival imaging to rule out background eclipsing binaries \n- Spectroscopic vetting using archival radial velocities\n- Gaia astrometry to constrain any wide companions\n\nTransit modeling was performed to derive planet properties like radius, period, and incident flux.\n\n### Training/Optimization \nNot applicable (observational study).\n\n## Key Results\n| **Parameter**                    | **Value**  |\n|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Planet Radius (R_Earth)          | 1.06 +0.06/-0.05 |\n| Orbital Period (days)            | 355 +200/-59 |\n| Semi-major Axis (AU)             | 0.88 +0.32/-0.10 |\n| Incident Flux (relative to Earth)| 0.29 +0.11/-0.13 |\n\n## Strengths\n- First detection of an Earth-sized, temperate planet candidate transiting a bright Sun-like star\n- Thorough vetting to rule out false positives\n- Promising target for future atmospheric characterization\n- Highlights potential of single-transit detections for bright stars\n\n## Limitations\n- Single transit event limits constraints on planet properties\n- Assumes circular orbit which may not be valid\n- Stellar parameters like mass have large uncertainties\n- Candidate requires confirmation via additional transits/methods\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe K2 photometry used is publicly available. Derived data products and code used in the analysis are available on a public repository.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis discovery represents an important milestone by potentially identifying the first Earth-sized exoplanet candidate in the habitable zone of a Sun-like star that is bright enough for detailed atmospheric characterization with next-generation observatories like JWST and ground-based ELTs. Confirmation and follow-up study of this system could provide key insights into the properties and potential habitability of temperate terrestrial exoplanets around Sun-like stars. The work also demonstrates the potential for single-transit detections to probe this elusive planet population with future high-precision photometric surveys."

Recent work on\nlarge language models (LLMs) suggests that self-reflection—the ability of a model to critique\nand revise its own outputs—can improve reasoning quality and factual consistency. Building on\nthis idea, this paper presents Reflective Translation, a prompting framework in which an LLM\ninternally evaluates and corrects its own translations through structured, multi-round prompting\nto improve semantic fidelity.\nThe method is evaluated using GPT-3.5 and Claude Haiku 3.5 on English–isiZulu and English–\nisiXhosa sentence pairs drawn from OPUS-100 and NTREX-African. Translation quality is\nassessed using BLEU and COMET. Across settings, second-pass translations improve consistently\nrelative to first-pass outputs. This paper further introduces a reflection-augmented dataset\nconsisting of (source, draft, critique, revision) tuples, enabling reproducible analysis of reflective\nbehavior. Overall, the results suggest that reflection-based prompting is a lightweight, model-\nagnostic approach for improving MT quality in under-resourced languages without fine-tuning or\nadditional labeled data.\n1\nIntroduction\nMachine Translation (MT) enables users to exchange information across languages without human\nintermediaries. The effectiveness of MT depends on linguistic accuracy, semantic faithfulness, and\ncontextual consistency. Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong translation\nperformance without task-specific fine-tuning (Brants et al., 2007; Moslem et al., 2023). However, a\nsubstantial gap remains in low-resource settings (Robinson et al., 2023; Haddow et al., 2022), where\nlimited parallel data can lead to hallucinations, omissions, and distortions (Wang and Sennrich,\n2020).\nAn emerging line of work studies self-reflection—prompting models to critique and refine their\nown outputs—as a mechanism to improve generation quality. Iterative prompting frameworks\nsuch as Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023), and Chain-of-Verification\n(Creswell and Shanahan, 2023) demonstrate that structured self-evaluation can improve factuality\nand consistency. Related approaches incorporate reflection signals through training or translation\npipelines (Li et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2024).\nThis paper investigates whether reflection can be applied as an inference-time correction step to\nimprove translation faithfulness without fine-tuning or new labeled data. Translation is treated as\nconstrained reasoning: the target sentence must preserve the meaning of the source. To operationalize\nthis, the proposed framework generates an initial translation, produces a structured self-critique\n1\narXiv:2601.19871v1  [cs.CL]  27 Jan 2026\n\nthat identifies typical translation errors (mistranslation, omission, semantic distortion), and then\nproduces a revised translation guided by the critique.\nContributions.\n• This paper proposes a reflection-guided prompting framework for MT in which models generate\nand act on structured self-assessments to improve translation faithfulness.\n• The framework is evaluated on OPUS-100 and NTREX-African for English–isiZulu and\nEnglish–isiXhosa across two LLMs (GPT-3.5 and Claude Haiku 3.5).\n• A reflection-augmented dataset of (source, draft, critique, revision) tuples is released to support\nreproducibility and future analysis.\n2\nMethods\n2.1\nReflective Translation\nReflective Translation is a prompting pipeline that guides a model to self-review its own translations\nand produce improved outputs via structured feedback. For each source sentence, GPT-3.5 (OpenAI,\n2023) and Claude Haiku 3.5 (Anthropic, 2024) generate a first-pass translation.

This is because CFD requires specialized expertise and is time-consuming and low throughput, making it difficult to support clinical trials. A deep learning model that maps IA morphology to biomechanical markers can address this, enabling physicians to obtain these markers in real time without performing CFD. Here, we show that a Graph Transformer model that incorporates temporal information, which is supervised by large CFD data, can accurately predict Wall Shear Stress (WSS) across the cardiac cycle from IA surface meshes. The model effectively captures the temporal variations of the WSS pattern, achieving a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of up to 0.981 and a maximum-based relative L2 error of 2.8%. Ablation studies and SOTA comparison confirmed its optimality. Further, as pulsatile CFD data is computationally expensive to generate and sample sizes are limited, we engaged a strategy of injecting a large amount of steady-state CFD data, which are extremely low-cost to generate, as augmentation. This approach enhances network performance substantially when pulsatile CFD data sample size is small. Our study provides a proof of concept that temporal sequences cardiovascular fluid mechanical parameters can be computed in real time using a deep learning model from the geometric mesh, and this is achievable even with small pulsatile CFD sample size. Our approach is likely applicable to other cardiovascular scenarios.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1. [Main contribution 1]\n2. [Main contribution 2]\n3.

In particular, we significantly improve the previously well-known baselines when $q$ is prime, showing that $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{2}$ contains matchings of size $q^{1.233}$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$ contains matchings of size $q^{d-o_{d}(1)}$.   These results and their proofs have several applications. First, we also obtain new constructions for finite field Nikodym sets in dimension $d \\geq 2$, improving recent results of Tao by polynomial factors. For example, when $q$ is prime, we show the existence of Nikodym sets in $\\mathbb{F}_q^d$ of size $q^d - q^{d - o_d(1)}$. Second, we construct a new minimal blocking set in $\\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$, solving a longstanding problem in finite geometry. Third, we obtain new constructions for the minimal distance problem (in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ and also in higher dimensions), improving a recent result of Logunov-Zakharov.   We also obtain analogous results for general finite fields with large characteristics. In particular, in one of our constructions we introduce a new special set of points inside the norm hypersurface in $\\mathbb{F}_{q}^{d}$, which directly generalizes the classical Hermitian unital and which may be of independent interest for applications.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1.

We consider a coopetitive setting where the MaaS platform purchases service capacity from service operators and sells multi-modal trips to travelers following an origin-destination-based pricing scheme; meanwhile, service operators use their remaining capacities to serve single-modal trips. As followers, travelers make both mode choices, including whether to use MaaS, and route choices in the multi-modal transportation network, subject to prices and congestion. Inspired by the dual formulation for traffic assignment problems, we propose a novel single-level variational inequality (VI) formulation by introducing a virtual traffic operator, along with the MaaS platform and multiple service operators. A key advantage of the proposed VI formulation is that it supports parallel solution procedures and thus enables large-scale applications. We prove that an equilibrium solution always exists given the negotiated wholesale price of service capacity. Numerical experiments on a small network further demonstrate that the wholesale price can be tailored to align with varying system-wide objectives. The proposed MaaS system demonstrates potential for creating a \"win-win-win\" outcome -- service operators and travelers are better off compared to the \"without MaaS\" scenario, meanwhile the MaaS platform remains profitable. Such a Pareto-improving regime can be explicitly specified with the wholesale capacity price. Similar conclusions are drawn from the experiment of an extended multi-modal Sioux Falls network, which also validates the scalability of the proposed model and solution algorithm.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1.

We investigate the frustrated array of strongly correlated spin dimers in the bilayer triangular lattice antiferromagnet \\rcs{} under applied magnetic fields. A cascade of magnetization plateaus appears at \\(M/M_s = 1/3, 1/2, 2/3,\\) and \\(5/6\\), together with a weak anomalous feature near \\(M/M_s = 1/6\\), in fields up to 60 T. Concurrent changes in magneto-dielectric response follows the plateau boundaries. The finite slope of each plateau and the absence of a zero-field gap in our ultralow-temperature ac susceptibility down to 20 mK indicate broken \\(U(1)\\) spin-rotation symmetry. A minimal bilayer-dimer model treated with bond operator representation reproduces the low-field sequence only when \\(U(1)\\) symmetry is explicitly lifted by spin-orbit-driven, bond-dependent anisotropy. Near saturation, a projected triangular pseudospin model accounts for the high-field plateaus with modest further-neighbor interactions. These results demonstrate that anisotropic exchange arising from spin-orbit-coupled moments is essential for stabilizing the full plateau hierarchy in \\rcs{}, a mechanism overlooked in previous interpretations of Co-based triangular bilayers.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: The paper focuses on magnetic systems and spin interactions, which have minimal direct relevance to quality engineering's Y=R+S+N decomposition framework.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: spin interactions, magnetic plateaus, symmetry breaking, quantum phases\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:52 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

Recent experimental measurements by COHERENT, CONUS+, and ton-scale xenon detectors--including PandaX-4T and XENONnT--underscore the need for a systematic theoretical framework to bridge high-energy physics scenarios with low-energy observational data. In this work, we develop a comprehensive end-to-end effective field theory (EFT) framework for CE$ν$NS, encompassing the complete energy scale hierarchy spanning the ultraviolet (UV) regime down to the nuclear sector. We consider the low-energy EFT (LEFT) operators up to dimension 8, incorporating their QCD renormalization group running effects, and employ the systematic spurion method to achieve the matching between these operators and the chiral Lagrangian. A full power counting analysis is performed, extending to nuclear response functions, which evaluates contributions from LEFT operators up to dimension 8 while accounting for the nucleon number enhancement effect intrinsic to CE$ν$NS. Moreover, we match the relevant LEFT operators for CE$ν$NS onto operators up to dimension 8 within the Standard Model EFT. By also providing their complete tree-level ultraviolet completions, this procedure establishes a consistent top-down theoretical workflow. Leveraging a broad suite of CE$ν$NS experimental data, this framework enables a combined analysis to extract constraints on the scales of EFT operators and neutrino non-standard interaction parameters.\n\n## Screening Result\nSCORE: 3\nREASON: While the paper discusses an effective field theory framework, it does not directly address the Y=R+S+N decomposition or quality engineering principles central to YRSN.\nKEY_CONCEPTS: effective field theory, neutrino scattering, systematic analysis, power counting, operator matching\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 12:54 | Model: Haiku (screening only)*\n*Low YRSN relevance - deep analysis skipped to save costs*\n"

Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1.

It argues that the current industry approach of simply scaling up models, data, and computational resources (growth-by-scaling) is unsustainable and impedes accessibility for academics and smaller companies. The authors propose market-based methods, specifically a cap-and-trade system, to incentivize AI efficiency and reduce emissions while opening opportunities for a wider range of participants.\n\nThe key idea is to cap the total allowable computations for AI deployment and issue tradable permits. Companies can then buy and sell these permits, creating a market that rewards efficiency. More efficient approaches would require fewer permits, generating surplus to sell. The authors derive an equilibrium showing their system reduces overall computations and emissions. Empirical validation also suggests it can improve company utility in certain scenarios.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Highlighting the growing computational demands, costs and environmental impact of large AI models, especially for language tasks.\n2. Proposing a market-based cap-and-trade framework to incentivize AI efficiency and sustainability.\n3. Deriving an equilibrium that shows the framework reduces overall computations and emissions.\n4. Empirically validating that the framework can improve company utility while driving efficiency.\n5. Advocating for a growth-by-efficiency approach over the current growth-by-scaling in AI development.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach is a cap-and-trade system for AI computations:\n- Set an overall cap on allowable computations for AI deployment\n- Issue tradable permits up to the cap amount\n- Companies must hold permits for the computations their AI systems use\n- Permits can be bought/sold, creating a market that rewards efficiency\n\n### Architecture \nNot applicable (economics paper proposing a framework)\n\n### Training/Optimization\nNot applicable\n\n## Key Results\nThe paper derives an equilibrium showing their proposed system reduces overall computations for AI deployment compared to a baseline without the system. Empirical results suggest the framework can improve company utility and drive efficiency adoption, though specific quantitative metrics are not provided.\n\n## Strengths\n- Highlights an important issue around AI sustainability and accessibility\n- Novel market-based approach to incentivize efficiency\n- Theoretical derivations and empirical validation\n- Relatively simple cap-and-trade framework that could be implemented\n\n## Limitations\n- Lack of specific quantitative results on efficiency gains or emission reductions\n- Challenges around setting appropriate cap levels and permit pricing\n- Potential for market manipulation or unfair competition\n- Focuses only on computations, not data efficiency or model compression\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe paper mentions empirical validation but does not provide code or data.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nIf successfully implemented, this framework could help mitigate the growing energy demands and environmental impact of AI systems. It could also level the playing field, increasing opportunities for academics and smaller companies in AI research and deployment. However, the feasibility and potential market distortions require further study. Overall, an interesting economic approach to a pressing issue in the AI field."

Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM. Code will be released upon publication.\n\n## Key Contributions\n*TODO: Extract from full paper*\n\n1. [Main contribution 1]\n2. [Main contribution 2]\n3.

      "reviewContent": "# Technical Review: M-SGWR: Multiscale Similarity and Geographically Weighted Regression\n\n## Paper Metadata\n- **Title**: M-SGWR: Multiscale Similarity and Geographically Weighted Regression\n- **Authors**: M. Naser Lessani, Zhenlong Li, Manzhu Yu, Helen Greatrex, Chan Shen\n- **ArXiv ID**: 2601.19888v1\n- **Published**: 2026-01-27\n- **Categories**: stat.ME, cs.AI, cs.LG\n\n## Summary\nThis paper proposes a new local regression framework called Multiscale Similarity and Geographically Weighted Regression (M-SGWR) that characterizes spatial interactions across two dimensions: geographic proximity and attribute (variable) similarity. Unlike traditional geographically weighted regression (GWR) models that solely rely on geographic proximity, M-SGWR combines geographic and attribute-based weight matrices using an optimized mixing parameter α. This allows the model to flexibly account for geographic, mixed, or non-spatial (remote similarity) effects for each predictor variable. The key novelty lies in assigning distinct α values and bandwidths to each predictor, enabling the model to capture the varying spatial scales and processes underlying different variables.\n\nThrough simulation experiments and an empirical application, the authors demonstrate that M-SGWR consistently outperforms GWR, SGWR, and MGWR across various goodness-of-fit metrics, highlighting its ability to better represent real-world spatial heterogeneity.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Proposing a new local regression framework (M-SGWR) that incorporates both geographic proximity and attribute similarity in characterizing spatial interactions.\n2. Introducing a mixing parameter α that governs the relative contribution of geographic and attribute-based weight matrices for each predictor variable.\n3. Allowing distinct α values and bandwidths for each predictor, enabling the model to capture varying spatial scales and processes underlying different variables.\n4. Developing an optimization procedure to determine the optimal α and bandwidth for each predictor, using diagnostic measures such as AICc and cross-validation.\n5. Demonstrating the superior performance of M-SGWR over existing methods (GWR, SGWR, MGWR) through simulation experiments and an empirical application.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach of M-SGWR is to combine geographic and attribute-based weight matrices for each predictor variable using an optimized mixing parameter α. This allows the model to account for both geographic proximity and attribute similarity in characterizing spatial interactions.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nThe M-SGWR model is an extension of the Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) framework, where each predictor variable is assigned its own optimal α value and bandwidth. The model architecture involves constructing separate geographic and attribute similarity weight matrices, which are then combined using the α parameter to form a mixed weight matrix for each variable.\n\n### Training/Optimization\nThe training and optimization process involves two key steps:\n1. Bandwidth optimization: For each candidate bandwidth, the optimal α value is determined using either a divide-and-conquer approach with adaptive step sizes or a greedy hill-climbing approach with fixed step sizes. The optimal bandwidth is selected based on diagnostic measures such as AICc or cross-validation.\n2. α optimization: For each predictor variable, the optimal α value is determined within the range [0, 1] during the backfitting process for bandwidth optimization. This controls the relative contribution of geographic and attribute-based weight matrices for that variable.\n\n## Key Results\nThe paper presents results from two simulation experiments and one empirical application, demonstrating the superior performance of M-SGWR compared to GWR, SGWR, and MGWR across various goodness-of-fit metrics, including AICc, CV score, and R-squared values.\n\n## Strengths\n- Addresses a key limitation of traditional GWR models by incorporating attribute similarity in addition to geographic proximity.\n- Allows for flexible modeling of spatial processes operating at different scales by assigning distinct α values and bandwidths to each predictor variable.\n- Provides a more realistic representation of real-world spatial heterogeneity and interactions.\n- Demonstrates consistent performance improvements over existing methods through simulation experiments and an empirical application.\n\n## Limitations\n- The computational complexity of the optimization process for determining optimal α and bandwidth values may be computationally intensive, especially for large datasets or high-dimensional problems.\n- The choice of attribute similarity measure and its potential impact on the model's performance are not extensively discussed.\n- The interpretation of the α parameter and its implications for understanding the underlying spatial processes may require further exploration.\n- The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other advanced spatial regression techniques, such as Bayesian spatially varying coefficient models or neural network-based approaches.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe authors do not explicitly mention the availability of code or data used in their study. However, they state that the M-SGWR model is implemented within the existing Python package \"mgwr,\" which suggests that the code may be available through that package or upon request from the authors.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe M-SGWR framework proposed in this paper has the potential to significantly impact various fields that rely on spatial regression analysis, such as geographic information science, public health, criminology, housing price modeling, environmental science, ecology, and geoscience. By providing a more flexible and accurate representation of spatial heterogeneity and interactions, M-SGWR can enhance the understanding and modeling of complex spatial processes. Additionally, the ability to capture both geographic proximity and attribute similarity effects can lead to improved decision-making and policy formulation in domains where spatial factors play a crucial role.\n\nHowever, the computational complexity of the optimization process and the potential challenges in interpreting the α parameter may limit the widespread adoption of M-SGWR, particularly in scenarios with large datasets or high-dimensional problems. Further research and development efforts may be required to address these limitations and facilitate the practical implementation of the proposed framework.\n\nOverall, the M-SGWR model represents a valuable contribution to the field of spatial regression analysis, offering a more comprehensive and nuanced approach to characterizing spatial interactions and heterogeneity."

It demonstrates that quantum trajectories can encode information beyond the unconditional dynamics, which has implications for quantum control, quantum error correction, and the interpretation of quantum measurements. The introduction of synthetic unravelings implemented as quantum circuits provides a practical and accessible platform for exploring these concepts experimentally. While the current work is limited to small-scale systems, the insights gained may inform future research on larger-scale quantum systems and the development of quantum technologies."

Fisch\n- **ArXiv ID**: 2601.19890v1\n- **Published**: 2026-01-27\n- **Categories**: physics.plasm-ph, physics.optics\n\n## Summary\nThis paper proposes a novel diagnostic method to directly measure solenoidal (rotational) turbulence in high-energy-density plasmas, such as those found in inertial confinement fusion experiments. Solenoidal turbulence is theorized to enhance fusion reactivity, but existing diagnostics cannot distinguish it from compressional turbulence. The authors suggest using the cross-polarization scattering of a probe laser to couple to the plasma vorticity, generating a cross-polarized signal proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy. This signal exhibits a diffractive \"Debye-Scherrer ring\" pattern that reveals the eddy size distribution. The technique is shown to be applicable to conditions at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and could bridge the gap between turbulence theory and fusion performance.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Proposed a new diagnostic approach to directly measure solenoidal turbulence in high-energy-density plasmas using laser polarization rotation.\n2. Demonstrated that the cross-polarized scattered signal acts as a calorimeter for shear flows, scaling with the turbulent kinetic energy.\n3. Identified a diffractive scattering signature (Debye-Scherrer ring) that can reveal the eddy size distribution of the turbulence.\n4. Showed the applicability of the technique to NIF implosion conditions and other high-energy-density scenarios.\n5. Highlighted the potential impact on optimizing ignition designs by leveraging shear flows and quantifying their reactivity enhancement.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach involves probing the plasma with a laser beam and analyzing the cross-polarized scattered light. The cross-polarization scattering couples to the plasma vorticity, generating a signal proportional to the turbulent kinetic energy. The diffractive scattering pattern (Debye-Scherrer ring) reveals the eddy size distribution.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nNot applicable (theoretical/diagnostic study).\n\n### Training/Optimization (if applicable)\nNot applicable (theoretical/diagnostic study).\n\n## Key Results\nThe paper does not provide specific quantitative results, as it is a theoretical/diagnostic proposal. However, it demonstrates the potential applicability of the technique to NIF implosion conditions and other high-energy-density scenarios.\n\n## Strengths\n- Proposes a novel diagnostic approach to directly measure solenoidal turbulence, which is currently challenging with existing methods.\n- Provides a way to quantify the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy size distribution, which are crucial inputs for evaluating the \"shear flow reactivity enhancement\" in fusion reactions.\n- Applicable to high-energy-density plasmas, such as those found in inertial confinement fusion experiments.\n- Could bridge the gap between turbulence theory and fusion performance, potentially leading to optimized ignition designs.\n\n## Limitations\n- Experimental challenges, such as refraction due to large density gradients, collisional absorption, and the presence of spontaneous magnetic fields, may complicate the implementation and interpretation of the diagnostic.\n- Advanced ray-tracing simulations and multi-wavelength probing may be required to deconvolve refractive effects and distinguish the turbulence scattering signal from other effects.\n- The paper does not provide specific quantitative results or experimental validation of the proposed technique.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe paper does not mention the availability of code or data, as it is a theoretical/diagnostic proposal.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nIf successfully implemented, this diagnostic technique could have a significant impact on the understanding and optimization of inertial confinement fusion experiments. By directly measuring solenoidal turbulence and quantifying its effects on fusion reactivity, the proposed method could bridge the gap between turbulence theory and fusion performance. This could lead to the development of ignition designs that leverage shear flows for enhanced reactivity, potentially improving the prospects of achieving practical fusion energy. However, the experimental challenges mentioned in the paper need to be addressed for successful implementation."

J., Annika Deutsch, Keiichi Maeda, Nathan Smith\n- **ArXiv ID**: 2601.19891v1\n- **Published**: 2026-01-27\n- **Categories**: astro-ph.HE\n- **PDF**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19891v1\n\n## Summary\nThis paper presents late-time X-ray and radio observations of four old Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) – SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s – to probe the mass-loss history of their progenitor stars in the centuries leading up to the supernova explosions. The authors derive mass-loss rates from the observed X-ray and radio emission, which is generated by the interaction between the supernova ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by the pre-explosion mass loss. Their key findings suggest that the mass-loss rates increased significantly in the final years before the explosions, necessitating a rapidly evolving progenitor process. The results provide insights into the late-stage evolution of massive stars and the progenitors of SNe IIn.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Derived mass-loss rates for four old SNe IIn (SN 2013L, SN 2014ab, SN 2015da, and KISS15s) from late-time X-ray and radio observations, probing the progenitor mass-loss history up to centuries before the explosions.\n2. Showed evidence for increasing mass-loss rates in the final years/centuries before the explosions, suggesting a rapidly evolving progenitor process.\n3. Demonstrated the importance of late-time X-ray and radio observations in disentangling the diversity within CSM-interacting supernovae and understanding the progenitors of SNe IIn.\n4. Provided new insights into the late-stage evolution of massive stars and the progenitors of SNe IIn, which are believed to be associated with luminous blue variable (LBV) stars or binary systems.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe authors obtained late-time (≥3000 days after the explosions) X-ray and radio observations of the four SNe IIn using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Very Large Array (VLA), and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). They analyzed the X-ray spectra and radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to derive the mass-loss rates of the progenitor stars at different epochs before the explosions.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nNot applicable (observational study).\n\n### Training/Optimization (if applicable)\nNot applicable (observational study).\n\n## Key Results\n| Supernova | Mass-Loss Rate (M⊙/yr) | Epoch (years pre-explosion) |\n|------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|\n| KISS15s    | ~4 × 10^-3              | ~450                       |\n| SN 2013L   | ~2 × 10^-3              | ~400                       |\n| SN 2014ab  | < 2 × 10^-3             | ~250                       |\n| SN 2015da  | < 2 × 10^-3             | ~300                       |\n\nThe derived mass-loss rates are lower than previous estimates from optical observations by 1-3 orders of magnitude, suggesting a rapidly increasing mass-loss rate in the final years/centuries before the explosions.\n\n## Strengths\n- Provides unique insights into the progenitor mass-loss history and late-stage evolution of massive stars by probing old SNe IIn.\n- Utilizes late-time X-ray and radio observations, which are crucial for studying CSM-interacting supernovae when they have faded at optical wavelengths.\n- Demonstrates the importance of multi-wavelength observations in understanding the diversity of SNe IIn and their progenitors.\n- Presents a comprehensive analysis of multiple SNe IIn, allowing for a broader understanding of the progenitor population.\n\n## Limitations\n- The sample size of four SNe IIn is relatively small, limiting the generalizability of the results.\n- The mass-loss rate estimates are subject to uncertainties in the modeling assumptions and the adopted parameters.\n- The study does not provide a definitive explanation for the rapidly increasing mass-loss rates observed in the final years/centuries before the explosions.\n- The connection between the derived mass-loss rates and specific progenitor scenarios (e.g., LBVs, binary systems) is not firmly established.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe paper does not mention the availability of code or data.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis study provides valuable insights into the late-stage evolution of massive stars and the progenitors of SNe IIn, which are believed to be associated with luminous blue variable (LBV) stars or binary systems. The findings of increasing mass-loss rates in the final years/centuries before the explosions challenge our understanding of single-star evolution models and suggest the need for more complex scenarios, such as binary interactions or episodic mass-loss events.\n\nThe paper demonstrates the importance of late-time X-ray and radio observations in studying CSM-interacting supernovae, as these wavelengths can probe the progenitor mass-loss history when the objects have faded at optical wavelengths. The multi-wavelength approach and the analysis of multiple SNe IIn contribute to a more robust understanding of this diverse class of supernovae.\n\nWhile the sample size is relatively small, and the study does not provide a definitive explanation for the observed mass-loss behavior, the results open up new avenues for future research. Further observations and modeling of old SNe IIn, combined with theoretical efforts to understand the underlying progenitor scenarios, can lead to a better comprehension of the late-stage evolution of massive stars and the progenitors of SNe IIn.\n\nOverall, this paper makes a significant contribution to the field of supernova astrophysics and stellar evolution, highlighting the importance of multi-wavelength observations and the need for more complex progenitor models to explain the observed mass-loss behavior in SNe IIn."

The key idea is to leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to allow users to authenticate and prove possession of EUDI Wallet credentials without revealing the credentials themselves. The authors argue that the current EUDI Wallet implementation diverges from true SSI principles by being centralized and user-centric rather than user-controlled. Their proposed solution aims to bridge this gap while maintaining legal and security guarantees.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Analysis of the divergence between the EUDI Wallet framework and SSI principles of decentralization and user control.\n2. Novel architecture integrating TEEs and ZKPs to enable SSI-compliant use of EUDI Wallet credentials.\n3. Detailed design of the ZKP protocol and credential issuance/verification flows.\n4. Implementation and evaluation of a proof-of-concept system.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe core approach involves using a TEE on the user's device to securely store and manage EUDI Wallet credentials. When a user needs to authenticate with a service provider, the TEE generates a ZKP that proves possession of the required credential without revealing the credential data itself.\n\n### Architecture \nThe proposed architecture consists of four main components:\n1. EUDI Wallet Issuer: Issues EUDI Wallet credentials to users.\n2. User Device with TEE: Securely stores credentials and generates ZKPs.\n3. Service Provider: Verifies ZKPs and grants access based on proven credentials.\n4. Blockchain: Used for transparent logging of credential issuance and revocation events.\n\n## Key Results\n- Proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating feasibility of the approach.\n- Evaluation showing reasonable performance overhead (e.g. ~200ms for ZKP generation on mobile device).\n- Analysis of security properties like credential privacy, unforgeability, and selective disclosure.\n\n## Strengths\n- Bridges gap between EUDI Wallet and SSI principles while maintaining legal/regulatory compliance.\n- Leverages hardware security capabilities (TEEs) for strong protection of credentials.\n- Allows selective disclosure of credential attributes via ZKPs.\n- Provides transparency and auditability via blockchain logging.\n\n## Limitations\n- Requires TEE support on user devices, which may not be universally available.\n- Additional complexity and trusted computing base from TEE and ZKP components.\n- Relatively high overhead for ZKP operations on resource-constrained devices.\n- Limited evaluation of real-world performance at scale.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe authors have released their proof-of-concept implementation code at https://github.com/EUDIWalletSSI/prototype.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nIf successfully adopted, this work could enable broader use of EUDI Wallet credentials in decentralized identity ecosystems, promoting user control and privacy while maintaining regulatory compliance. However, challenges around TEE availability, performance overhead, and added complexity may impact real-world deployability. Further research on efficient ZKP schemes and TEE architectures could help mitigate some of the limitations."

The authors show that at finite temperatures, these non-integrable models can exhibit superdiffusive spin transport following the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class, as well as ballistic energy transport over an intermediate time window. This contrasts with the common assumption that integrability is required for anomalous transport. The study focuses on numerical simulations of two specific models from the family, corresponding to n=1 (Landau-Lifshitz model) and n=2. Finite-temperature acts as a regulator, allowing the observation of anomalous transport before the onset of diffusive behavior at very long times.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Demonstration of KPZ superdiffusive spin transport in non-integrable classical spin field theories at low temperatures.\n2. Observation of ballistic energy transport in the same non-integrable models over intermediate time scales.  \n3. Characterization of the crossover from anomalous to normal diffusive transport as temperature increases.\n4. Evidence that long-lived soliton-like trajectories may underlie the anomalous transport in these non-integrable systems.\n5. Numerical study of a family of spin field theories parametrized by an integer n, comparing the integrable n=1 and non-integrable n=2 cases.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe authors numerically simulate the dynamics of a family of one-dimensional classical spin field theories governed by the Landau-Lifshitz equation. They compute spin and energy density correlation functions from the simulated trajectories and analyze their scaling behavior to characterize transport properties.\n\n### Architecture \nNot applicable (theory/numerical study).\n\n### Training/Optimization\nNot applicable (theory/numerical study).\n\n## Key Results\nThe key results include:\n- Scaling collapse of the spin density correlation function cm(x,t) onto the KPZ scaling form at low temperatures for both n=1 and n=2 models.\n- Ballistic scaling |ch(x,t)| ~ t of the energy density correlation function at low temperatures.\n- Crossover to diffusive transport cm(x,t) ~ x^2/t, |ch(x,t)| ~ 1/sqrt(t) at high temperatures.\n- Visual evidence of long-lived soliton-like structures in the spin density profiles at low temperatures.\n\n## Strengths\n- Reveals anomalous transport in a new class of non-integrable classical field theories.\n- Combines analytical arguments with extensive numerical simulations.\n- Systematic study across a family of models parametrized by n.\n- Careful finite-size scaling analysis to identify asymptotic regimes.\n\n## Limitations\n- Restricted to one-dimensional spin field theories; generality to higher dimensions unclear.\n- Relies on numerical simulations; no exact analytical results.\n- Soliton picture of anomalous transport remains a conjecture requiring further study.\n- Finite-temperature regulator may have limited applicability in some experimental settings.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe paper does not explicitly mention code or data availability.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis work challenges the conventional wisdom that integrability is required for anomalous transport, by demonstrating KPZ superdiffusion and ballistic transport in non-integrable classical spin field theories. The findings open up new avenues for understanding anomalous transport in non-integrable systems more broadly. The soliton interpretation, if further substantiated, could provide insights into the microscopic origins of anomalous scaling. While the one-dimensional setting limits immediate applications, the concepts explored have potential relevance for transport in other non-integrable classical and quantum systems lacking quasiparticle descriptions."

Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at scale caused its replacement by Pre-LN in modern LLMs. We show that the central failure mode of Post-LN arises from the ResNet-style residual pathway, which introduces gradient vanishing in deep networks. We present Keel, a Post-LN Transformer that replaces this residual path with a Highway-style connection. This modification preserves the gradient flow through the residual branch, preventing signal vanishing from the top layers to the bottom. Unlike prior methods, Keel enables stable training at extreme depths without requiring specialized initialization or complex optimization tricks. Keel trains robustly at depths exceeding 1000 layers and consistently improves perplexity and depth-scaling characteristics over Pre-LN.

The effective impurity problem is mapped to a finite one-dimensional chain with a small number of bath sites, which is solved via exact diagonalization. The hybridization function is iteratively updated through time-domain fitting until self-consistency is achieved.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nNot applicable (theoretical/computational study).\n\n### Training/Optimization (if applicable)\nNot applicable (theoretical/computational study).\n\n## Key Results\nThe authors successfully demonstrate stable convergence of the real-time iteration scheme across a wide range of interaction strengths for the half-filled Hubbard model on a Bethe lattice. The spectral functions clearly exhibit the emergence of Hubbard bands and the suppression of spectral weight at the Fermi level as the interaction strength increases, capturing the metal-to-insulator transition.\n\n## Strengths\n- Overcomes limitations of conventional DMFT methods by operating directly in the time domain, making it suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware.\n- Delivers detailed spectral features while preserving efficiency and quantum computing compatibility.\n- Successful demonstration of the metal-to-insulator transition and the emergence of Hubbard bands in the spectral functions.\n- Establishes a robust framework for capturing key spectral features via DMFT simulations on near-term quantum devices.\n\n## Limitations\n- Limited time resolution and minimal bath discretization were used in the proof-of-concept implementation.\n- Exact diagonalization was used as the impurity solver, which may not be scalable for larger systems or more complex models.\n- No direct implementation on quantum hardware was demonstrated in this work.\n- The convergence and accuracy of the method for more complex systems or models were not explored.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe authors do not explicitly mention the availability of code or data associated with this work.\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThis work presents a promising approach for solving DMFT self-consistent equations on near-term quantum computing hardware, enabling the simulation of strongly correlated materials and the study of their spectral properties. By overcoming limitations of conventional DMFT methods and two-site approximations, this real-time iteration scheme has the potential to provide more accurate and detailed insights into the electronic structure and phase transitions of correlated systems. However, further development is needed to address the limitations of the current implementation, such as the use of exact diagonalization as the impurity solver and the limited time resolution and bath discretization. Additionally, the method's performance and scalability for more complex systems and models should be thoroughly evaluated. Overall, this work represents a significant step towards leveraging near-term quantum computing capabilities for the study of strongly correlated materials and paves the way for future advancements in this field."

In this way, SDFT enables true con-\ntinual learning with the model improving on new tasks\nas they arise without regressing existing capabilities.\nFoundation models have achieved remarkable suc-\ncess in recent years, powering AI applications\nacross language, vision, robotics, and beyond. How-\never, despite their impressive capabilities, today’s\nAI systems remain static after deployment. While\nthey can adapt their behavior at inference time\nthrough mechanisms such as retrieval or prompting,\nthey do not update their parameters to acquire new\nskills, internalize new knowledge, or improve from\nexperience. To enable the next generation of foun-\ndation models, we must solve the problem of con-\ntinual learning: enabling AI systems to keep learn-\ning and improving over time, similar to how humans\naccumulate knowledge and refine skills throughout\ntheir lives (Hassabis et al., 2017; De Lange et al.,\n2021).\nA growing body of recent work has highlighted\nthe importance of on-policy learning for contin-\nual learning. When models learn from data gener-\nated by their current policy, they exhibit substan-\ntially reduced catastrophic forgetting compared to\noff-policy alternatives (Shenfeld et al., 2025; Chen\net al., 2025). To date, most successful on-policy ap-\nproaches have been developed in the context of re-\ninforcement learning (RL), where feedback is pro-\nvided through an explicit reward function. However, in many real-world settings such rewards are unavail-\nable or difficult to specify. Instead, learning typically proceeds from datasets of expert demonstrations. The\ndominant paradigm in this regime is supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which trains the model to imitate expert\n∗Correspondence to idanshen@mit.edu.\n1\narXiv:2601.19897v1  [cs.LG]  27 Jan 2026\n\nSelf-Distillation Enables Continual Learning\nDemonstration\nLLM θ\nTeacher Mode\nStudent Mode\nToken Distribution P\nToken Distribution Q\nNext token \nsampled from P\nQuery\n𝔼!∼# log 𝑃\n𝑄\nOn-Policy Distillation\nGradient\nBase \nPolicy\nDemonstrator\nTeacher\nSDFT\n1.2\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n1.0\n1.1\nD...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:14 | Backend: template*\n"

Arabic calligraphy presents unique challenges due to its artistic stylization, complex ligatures, and visual variations across different calligraphic styles. The authors curated a dataset of 1,272 samples spanning six major Arabic calligraphic styles, with sentence-level text transcriptions and bounding box annotations.\n\nThrough comprehensive evaluation on 13 leading Arabic and multilingual models, the paper highlights significant performance gaps on stylized calligraphic text compared to plain text. The authors aim to foster research on culturally grounded AI systems that can process the Arabic language's rich visual heritage.\n\n## Key Contributions\n1. Introduced DuwatBench, a new benchmark dataset for Arabic calligraphy understanding in multimodal models.\n2. Curated a diverse dataset of 1,272 samples across six major calligraphic styles, with sentence-level transcriptions and bounding box annotations.\n3. Conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 13 state-of-the-art Arabic and multilingual models on DuwatBench, revealing significant performance gaps on stylized calligraphic text.\n4. Released the dataset and evaluation suite to promote research on culturally grounded AI systems for the Arabic language and visual heritage.\n5. Highlighted the importance of fair inclusion of Arabic calligraphy in AI systems for cultural preservation and digital humanities applications.\n\n## Methodology\n### Core Approach\nThe authors curated the DuwatBench dataset by collecting real-world Arabic calligraphy samples from various sources, covering six major calligraphic styles (Thuluth, Diwani, Kufic, Naskh, Ruq'ah, and Nasta'liq). The samples were annotated with sentence-level transcriptions and bounding boxes for text detection tasks.\n\n### Architecture (if applicable)\nNot applicable (dataset paper).\n\n### Training/Optimization (if applicable)\nNot applicable (dataset paper).\n\n## Key Results\nThe authors evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual models on DuwatBench using five complementary metrics: Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), Character F-score (ChRF), Exact Match, and Normalized Levenshtein Distance (NLD). The results are summarized in the following table:\n\n| Model | CER ↓ | WER ↓ | ChRF ↑ | Exact Match ↑ | NLD ↓ |\n|-------|-------|-------|--------|----------------|-------|\n| gemini-2.5-flash (closed-source) | 0.3700 | 0.4478 | 71.8174 | 0.4167 | 0.3166 |\n| gemma-3-27b-it (open-source) | 0.5556 | 0.6591 | 51.5330 | 0.2398 | 0.4741 |\n| mbzuai/ain (open-source, Arabic-specific) | 0.5494 | 0.6912 | 42.6675 | 0.1895 | 0.5134 |\n| trocr-base-arabic-handwritten (open-source, Arabic-specific) | 0.9728 | 0.9998 | 1.7938 | 0.0000 | 0.9632 |\n\nThe results highlight clear performance gaps across models, with larger multimodal models like Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma-3-27b-it showing stronger robustness, while others struggle with highly stylized calligraphic text.\n\n## Strengths\n- Introduces a much-needed benchmark for evaluating multimodal models on Arabic calligraphy, a culturally significant yet underexplored domain.\n- Provides a diverse and curated dataset spanning multiple calligraphic styles and text categories, enabling comprehensive evaluation.\n- Includes sentence-level transcriptions and bounding box annotations, supporting both text recognition and detection tasks.\n- Highlights the importance of fair inclusion of Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems.\n- Promotes research on culturally grounded AI and digital humanities applications.\n\n## Limitations\n- The dataset size (1,272 samples) is relatively small compared to large-scale general-purpose Arabic corpora, potentially limiting model training.\n- The dataset focuses specifically on Arabic calligraphy and may not generalize to other languages or domains.\n- The annotation process and quality control measures are not described in detail.\n- The paper does not provide insights into potential biases or ethical considerations in the dataset curation process.\n\n## Code/Data Availability\nThe authors have made the DuwatBench dataset and evaluation suite publicly available:\n- Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench\n- Evaluation Suite: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench\n\n## Impact Assessment\nThe introduction of DuwatBench addresses an important gap in the fair inclusion of Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems. By providing a benchmark for evaluating multimodal models on Arabic calligraphy, the authors promote research on culturally grounded AI systems and support applications in cultural preservation, digital archiving, and education.\n\nThe dataset's diversity across calligraphic styles and text categories, along with its realistic artistic backgrounds, offers a valuable testbed for developing robust and culturally aware AI models. However, the relatively small dataset size may limit its impact on large-scale model training and generalization to other domains.\n\nOverall, DuwatBench represents a positive step towards fair and inclusive AI development, fostering research that respects and preserves the rich cultural significance of the Arabic script while advancing the state of the art in multimodal understanding."

Early developments in general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-3 and its successors) revealed\nemergent capabilities in clinical summarisation, question answering, report generation, coding support and contextual\nreasoning (Brown et al., 2020). Subsequent work has shown that domain-adapted models, such as BioGPT (Luo\net al., 2022), BioMedLM, PubMedBERT (Gu et al., 2021) and Med-PaLM (Singhal et al., 2023), achieve expert-\nlevel performance on diverse medical reasoning benchmarks. An expanding evidence base further demonstrates\nthat LLMs can reliably extract salient clinical information and support guideline-informed recommendations when\ndeployed with appropriate safeguards. Recent prospective evaluations in hospital settings indicate that LLM-assisted\nclinical documentation can meaningfully reduce clinician workload while maintaining high linguistic quality (Bracken\net al., 2025; Nori et al., 2023). Nevertheless, these systems continue to require rigorous oversight owing to risks of\nhallucinations, incomplete contextualisation and occasional misinterpretation of clinical guidelines.\nIn medicine, multidisciplinary management (MDM) offers cancer patients the advantage of having specialists from\ndifferent medical fields collaboratively involved in treatment planning. This approach is usually implemented through\nmultidisciplinary clinics, such as breast units, where various experts assess patients, perform physical examinations,\nrequest and conduct diagnostic tests efficiently, and jointly evaluate potential treatment options. MDM is also conducted\nthrough multidisciplinary tumour board (MDTB) meetings, which are structured sessions in which all relevant patient\narXiv:2601.19899v1  [cs.CL]  27 Jan 2026\n\ninformation is collected, and key specialists convene to discuss the diagnosis and management of cancer patients\n(El ...\n```\n\n\n---\n*Generated: 2026-01-28 10:01 by YRSN Research Monitor (rule-based)*\n*Tip: Set AWS credentials or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for LLM-powered analysis*\n"
